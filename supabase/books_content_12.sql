Robert’s little son was only five years old. This child was taken, too,
and carried before the King, sobbing and crying; for, young as he was,
he knew he had good reason to be afraid of his Royal uncle. The King
was not much accustomed to pity those who were in his power, but his
cold heart seemed for the moment to soften towards the boy. He was
observed to make a great effort, as if to prevent himself from being
cruel, and ordered the child to be taken away; whereupon a certain
Baron, who had married a daughter of Duke Robert’s (by name, Helie of
Saint Saen), took charge of him, tenderly. The King’s gentleness did
not last long. Before two years were over, he sent messengers to this
lord’s Castle to seize the child and bring him away. The Baron was not
there at the time, but his servants were faithful, and carried the boy
off in his sleep and hid him. When the Baron came home, and was told
what the King had done, he took the child abroad, and, leading him by
the hand, went from King to King and from Court to Court, relating how
the child had a claim to the throne of England, and how his uncle the
King, knowing that he had that claim, would have murdered him, perhaps,
but for his escape.

The youth and innocence of the pretty little William Fitz-Robert (for
that was his name) made him many friends at that time. When he became a
young man, the King of France, uniting with the French Counts of Anjou
and Flanders, supported his cause against the King of England, and took
many of the King’s towns and castles in Normandy. But, King Henry,
artful and cunning always, bribed some of William’s friends with money,
some with promises, some with power. He bought off the Count of Anjou,
by promising to marry his eldest son, also named William, to the
Count’s daughter; and indeed the whole trust of this King’s life was in
such bargains, and he believed (as many another King has done since,
and as one King did in France a very little time ago) that every man’s
truth and honour can be bought at some price. For all this, he was so
afraid of William Fitz-Robert and his friends, that, for a long time,
he believed his life to be in danger; and never lay down to sleep, even
in his palace surrounded by his guards, without having a sword and
buckler at his bedside.

To strengthen his power, the King with great ceremony betrothed his
eldest daughter Matilda, then a child only eight years old, to be the
wife of Henry the Fifth, the Emperor of Germany. To raise her
marriage-portion, he taxed the English people in a most oppressive
manner; then treated them to a great procession, to restore their good
humour; and sent Matilda away, in fine state, with the German
ambassadors, to be educated in the country of her future husband.

And now his Queen, Maud the Good, unhappily died. It was a sad thought
for that gentle lady, that the only hope with which she had married a
man whom she had never loved—the hope of reconciling the Norman and
English races—had failed. At the very time of her death, Normandy and
all France was in arms against England; for, so soon as his last danger
was over, King Henry had been false to all the French powers he had
promised, bribed, and bought, and they had naturally united against
him. After some fighting, however, in which few suffered but the
unhappy common people (who always suffered, whatsoever was the matter),
he began to promise, bribe, and buy again; and by those means, and by
the help of the Pope, who exerted himself to save more bloodshed, and
by solemnly declaring, over and over again, that he really was in
earnest this time, and would keep his word, the King made peace.

One of the first consequences of this peace was, that the King went
over to Normandy with his son Prince William and a great retinue, to
have the Prince acknowledged as his successor by the Norman Nobles, and
to contract the promised marriage (this was one of the many promises
the King had broken) between him and the daughter of the Count of
Anjou. Both these things were triumphantly done, with great show and
rejoicing; and on the twenty-fifth of November, in the year one
thousand one hundred and twenty, the whole retinue prepared to embark
at the Port of Barfleur, for the voyage home.

On that day, and at that place, there came to the King, Fitz-Stephen, a
sea-captain, and said:

‘My liege, my father served your father all his life, upon the sea. He
steered the ship with the golden boy upon the prow, in which your
father sailed to conquer England. I beseech you to grant me the same
office. I have a fair vessel in the harbour here, called The White
Ship, manned by fifty sailors of renown. I pray you, Sire, to let your
servant have the honour of steering you in The White Ship to England!’

‘I am sorry, friend,’ replied the King, ‘that my vessel is already
chosen, and that I cannot (therefore) sail with the son of the man who
served my father. But the Prince and all his company shall go along
with you, in the fair White Ship, manned by the fifty sailors of
renown.’

An hour or two afterwards, the King set sail in the vessel he had
chosen, accompanied by other vessels, and, sailing all night with a
fair and gentle wind, arrived upon the coast of England in the morning.
While it was yet night, the people in some of those ships heard a faint
wild cry come over the sea, and wondered what it was.

Now, the Prince was a dissolute, debauched young man of eighteen, who
bore no love to the English, and had declared that when he came to the
throne he would yoke them to the plough like oxen. He went aboard The
White Ship, with one hundred and forty youthful Nobles like himself,
among whom were eighteen noble ladies of the highest rank. All this gay
company, with their servants and the fifty sailors, made three hundred
souls aboard the fair White Ship.

‘Give three casks of wine, Fitz-Stephen,’ said the Prince, ‘to the
fifty sailors of renown! My father the King has sailed out of the
harbour. What time is there to make merry here, and yet reach England
with the rest?’

‘Prince!’ said Fitz-Stephen, ‘before morning, my fifty and The White
Ship shall overtake the swiftest vessel in attendance on your father
the King, if we sail at midnight!’

Then the Prince commanded to make merry; and the sailors drank out the
three casks of wine; and the Prince and all the noble company danced in
the moonlight on the deck of The White Ship.

When, at last, she shot out of the harbour of Barfleur, there was not a
sober seaman on board. But the sails were all set, and the oars all
going merrily. Fitz-Stephen had the helm. The gay young nobles and the
beautiful ladies, wrapped in mantles of various bright colours to
protect them from the cold, talked, laughed, and sang. The Prince
encouraged the fifty sailors to row harder yet, for the honour of The
White Ship.

Crash! A terrific cry broke from three hundred hearts. It was the cry
the people in the distant vessels of the King heard faintly on the
water. The White Ship had struck upon a rock—was filling—going down!

Fitz-Stephen hurried the Prince into a boat, with some few Nobles.
‘Push off,’ he whispered; ‘and row to land. It is not far, and the sea
is smooth. The rest of us must die.’

But, as they rowed away, fast, from the sinking ship, the Prince heard
the voice of his sister Marie, the Countess of Perche, calling for
help. He never in his life had been so good as he was then. He cried in
an agony, ‘Row back at any risk! I cannot bear to leave her!’

They rowed back. As the Prince held out his arms to catch his sister,
such numbers leaped in, that the boat was overset. And in the same
instant The White Ship went down.

Only two men floated. They both clung to the main yard of the ship,
which had broken from the mast, and now supported them. One asked the
other who he was? He said, ‘I am a nobleman, Godfrey by name, the son
of Gilbert de l’Aigle. And you?’ said he. ‘I am Berold, a poor butcher
of Rouen,’ was the answer. Then, they said together, ‘Lord be merciful
to us both!’ and tried to encourage one another, as they drifted in the
cold benumbing sea on that unfortunate November night.

By-and-by, another man came swimming towards them, whom they knew, when
he pushed aside his long wet hair, to be Fitz-Stephen. ‘Where is the
Prince?’ said he. ‘Gone! Gone!’ the two cried together. ‘Neither he,
nor his brother, nor his sister, nor the King’s niece, nor her brother,
nor any one of all the brave three hundred, noble or commoner, except
we three, has risen above the water!’ Fitz-Stephen, with a ghastly
face, cried, ‘Woe! woe, to me!’ and sunk to the bottom.

The other two clung to the yard for some hours. At length the young
noble said faintly, ‘I am exhausted, and chilled with the cold, and can
hold no longer. Farewell, good friend! God preserve you!’ So, he
dropped and sunk; and of all the brilliant crowd, the poor Butcher of
Rouen alone was saved. In the morning, some fishermen saw him floating
in his sheep-skin coat, and got him into their boat—the sole relater of
the dismal tale.

For three days, no one dared to carry the intelligence to the King. At
length, they sent into his presence a little boy, who, weeping
bitterly, and kneeling at his feet, told him that The White Ship was
lost with all on board. The King fell to the ground like a dead man,
and never, never afterwards, was seen to smile.

But he plotted again, and promised again, and bribed and bought again,
in his old deceitful way. Having no son to succeed him, after all his
pains (‘The Prince will never yoke us to the plough, now!’ said the
English people), he took a second wife—Adelais or Alice, a duke’s
daughter, and the Pope’s niece. Having no more children, however, he
proposed to the Barons to swear that they would recognise as his
successor, his daughter Matilda, whom, as she was now a widow, he
married to the eldest son of the Count of Anjou, Geoffrey, surnamed
Plantagenet, from a custom he had of wearing a sprig of flowering broom
(called Genêt in French) in his cap for a feather. As one false man
usually makes many, and as a false King, in particular, is pretty
certain to make a false Court, the Barons took the oath about the
succession of Matilda (and her children after her), twice over, without
in the least intending to keep it. The King was now relieved from any
remaining fears of William Fitz-Robert, by his death in the Monastery
of St. Omer, in France, at twenty-six years old, of a pike-wound in the
hand. And as Matilda gave birth to three sons, he thought the
succession to the throne secure.

He spent most of the latter part of his life, which was troubled by
family quarrels, in Normandy, to be near Matilda. When he had reigned
upward of thirty-five years, and was sixty-seven years old, he died of
an indigestion and fever, brought on by eating, when he was far from
well, of a fish called Lamprey, against which he had often been
cautioned by his physicians. His remains were brought over to Reading
Abbey to be buried.

You may perhaps hear the cunning and promise-breaking of King Henry the
First, called ‘policy’ by some people, and ‘diplomacy’ by others.
Neither of these fine words will in the least mean that it was true;
and nothing that is not true can possibly be good.

His greatest merit, that I know of, was his love of learning—I should
have given him greater credit even for that, if it had been strong
enough to induce him to spare the eyes of a certain poet he once took
prisoner, who was a knight besides. But he ordered the poet’s eyes to
be torn from his head, because he had laughed at him in his verses; and
the poet, in the pain of that torture, dashed out his own brains
against his prison wall. King Henry the First was avaricious,
revengeful, and so false, that I suppose a man never lived whose word
was less to be relied upon.', 2188)

laboured at so long, and lied so much for, crumbled away like a hollow
heap of sand. Stephen, whom he had never mistrusted or suspected,
started up to claim the throne.

Stephen was the son of Adela, the Conqueror’s daughter, married to the
Count of Blois. To Stephen, and to his brother Henry, the late King had
been liberal; making Henry Bishop of Winchester, and finding a good
marriage for Stephen, and much enriching him. This did not prevent
Stephen from hastily producing a false witness, a servant of the late
King, to swear that the King had named him for his heir upon his
death-bed. On this evidence the Archbishop of Canterbury crowned him.
The new King, so suddenly made, lost not a moment in seizing the Royal
treasure, and hiring foreign soldiers with some of it to protect his
throne.

If the dead King had even done as the false witness said, he would have
had small right to will away the English people, like so many sheep or
oxen, without their consent. But he had, in fact, bequeathed all his
territory to Matilda; who, supported by Robert, Earl of Gloucester,
soon began to dispute the crown. Some of the powerful barons and
priests took her side; some took Stephen’s; all fortified their
castles; and again the miserable English people were involved in war,
from which they could never derive advantage whosoever was victorious,
and in which all parties plundered, tortured, starved, and ruined them.

Five years had passed since the death of Henry the First—and during
those five years there had been two terrible invasions by the people of
Scotland under their King, David, who was at last defeated with all his
army—when Matilda, attended by her brother Robert and a large force,
appeared in England to maintain her claim. A battle was fought between
her troops and King Stephen’s at Lincoln; in which the King himself was
taken prisoner, after bravely fighting until his battle-axe and sword
were broken, and was carried into strict confinement at Gloucester.
Matilda then submitted herself to the Priests, and the Priests crowned
her Queen of England.

She did not long enjoy this dignity. The people of London had a great
affection for Stephen; many of the Barons considered it degrading to be
ruled by a woman; and the Queen’s temper was so haughty that she made
innumerable enemies. The people of London revolted; and, in alliance
with the troops of Stephen, besieged her at Winchester, where they took
her brother Robert prisoner, whom, as her best soldier and chief
general, she was glad to exchange for Stephen himself, who thus
regained his liberty. Then, the long war went on afresh. Once, she was
pressed so hard in the Castle of Oxford, in the winter weather when the
snow lay thick upon the ground, that her only chance of escape was to
dress herself all in white, and, accompanied by no more than three
faithful Knights, dressed in like manner that their figures might not
be seen from Stephen’s camp as they passed over the snow, to steal away
on foot, cross the frozen Thames, walk a long distance, and at last
gallop away on horseback. All this she did, but to no great purpose
then; for her brother dying while the struggle was yet going on, she at
last withdrew to Normandy.

In two or three years after her withdrawal her cause appeared in
England, afresh, in the person of her son Henry, young Plantagenet,
who, at only eighteen years of age, was very powerful: not only on
account of his mother having resigned all Normandy to him, but also
from his having married Eleanor, the divorced wife of the French King,
a bad woman, who had great possessions in France. Louis, the French
King, not relishing this arrangement, helped Eustace, King Stephen’s
son, to invade Normandy: but Henry drove their united forces out of
that country, and then returned here, to assist his partisans, whom the
King was then besieging at Wallingford upon the Thames. Here, for two
days, divided only by the river, the two armies lay encamped opposite
to one another—on the eve, as it seemed to all men, of another
desperate fight, when the Earl of Arundel took heart and said ‘that it
was not reasonable to prolong the unspeakable miseries of two kingdoms
to minister to the ambition of two princes.’

Many other noblemen repeating and supporting this when it was once
uttered, Stephen and young Plantagenet went down, each to his own bank
of the river, and held a conversation across it, in which they arranged
a truce; very much to the dissatisfaction of Eustace, who swaggered
away with some followers, and laid violent hands on the Abbey of St.
Edmund’s-Bury, where he presently died mad. The truce led to a solemn
council at Winchester, in which it was agreed that Stephen should
retain the crown, on condition of his declaring Henry his successor;
that William, another son of the King’s, should inherit his father’s
rightful possessions; and that all the Crown lands which Stephen had
given away should be recalled, and all the Castles he had permitted to
be built demolished. Thus terminated the bitter war, which had now
lasted fifteen years, and had again laid England waste. In the next
year Stephen died, after a troubled reign of nineteen years.

Although King Stephen was, for the time in which he lived, a humane and
moderate man, with many excellent qualities; and although nothing worse
is known of him than his usurpation of the Crown, which he probably
excused to himself by the consideration that King Henry the First was a
usurper too—which was no excuse at all; the people of England suffered
more in these dread nineteen years, than at any former period even of
their suffering history. In the division of the nobility between the
two rival claimants of the Crown, and in the growth of what is called
the Feudal System (which made the peasants the born vassals and mere
slaves of the Barons), every Noble had his strong Castle, where he
reigned the cruel king of all the neighbouring people. Accordingly, he
perpetrated whatever cruelties he chose. And never were worse cruelties
committed upon earth than in wretched England in those nineteen years.

The writers who were living then describe them fearfully. They say that
the castles were filled with devils rather than with men; that the
peasants, men and women, were put into dungeons for their gold and
silver, were tortured with fire and smoke, were hung up by the thumbs,
were hung up by the heels with great weights to their heads, were torn
with jagged irons, killed with hunger, broken to death in narrow chests
filled with sharp-pointed stones, murdered in countless fiendish ways.
In England there was no corn, no meat, no cheese, no butter, there were
no tilled lands, no harvests. Ashes of burnt towns, and dreary wastes,
were all that the traveller, fearful of the robbers who prowled abroad
at all hours, would see in a long day’s journey; and from sunrise until
night, he would not come upon a home.

The clergy sometimes suffered, and heavily too, from pillage, but many
of them had castles of their own, and fought in helmet and armour like
the barons, and drew lots with other fighting men for their share of
booty. The Pope (or Bishop of Rome), on King Stephen’s resisting his
ambition, laid England under an Interdict at one period of this reign;
which means that he allowed no service to be performed in the churches,
no couples to be married, no bells to be rung, no dead bodies to be
buried. Any man having the power to refuse these things, no matter
whether he were called a Pope or a Poulterer, would, of course, have
the power of afflicting numbers of innocent people. That nothing might
be wanting to the miseries of King Stephen’s time, the Pope threw in
this contribution to the public store—not very like the widow’s
contribution, as I think, when Our Saviour sat in Jerusalem
over-against the Treasury, ‘and she threw in two mites, which make a
farthing.’', 1384)

Henry Plantagenet, when he was but twenty-one years old, quietly
succeeded to the throne of England, according to his agreement made
with the late King at Winchester. Six weeks after Stephen’s death, he
and his Queen, Eleanor, were crowned in that city; into which they rode
on horseback in great state, side by side, amidst much shouting and
rejoicing, and clashing of music, and strewing of flowers.

The reign of King Henry the Second began well. The King had great
possessions, and (what with his own rights, and what with those of his
wife) was lord of one-third part of France. He was a young man of
vigour, ability, and resolution, and immediately applied himself to
remove some of the evils which had arisen in the last unhappy reign. He
revoked all the grants of land that had been hastily made, on either
side, during the late struggles; he obliged numbers of disorderly
soldiers to depart from England; he reclaimed all the castles belonging
to the Crown; and he forced the wicked nobles to pull down their own
castles, to the number of eleven hundred, in which such dismal
cruelties had been inflicted on the people. The King’s brother,
Geoffrey, rose against him in France, while he was so well employed,
and rendered it necessary for him to repair to that country; where,
after he had subdued and made a friendly arrangement with his brother
(who did not live long), his ambition to increase his possessions
involved him in a war with the French King, Louis, with whom he had
been on such friendly terms just before, that to the French King’s
infant daughter, then a baby in the cradle, he had promised one of his
little sons in marriage, who was a child of five years old. However,
the war came to nothing at last, and the Pope made the two Kings
friends again.

Now, the clergy, in the troubles of the last reign, had gone on very
ill indeed. There were all kinds of criminals among them—murderers,
thieves, and vagabonds; and the worst of the matter was, that the good
priests would not give up the bad priests to justice, when they
committed crimes, but persisted in sheltering and defending them. The
King, well knowing that there could be no peace or rest in England
while such things lasted, resolved to reduce the power of the clergy;
and, when he had reigned seven years, found (as he considered) a good
opportunity for doing so, in the death of the Archbishop of Canterbury.
‘I will have for the new Archbishop,’ thought the King, ‘a friend in
whom I can trust, who will help me to humble these rebellious priests,
and to have them dealt with, when they do wrong, as other men who do
wrong are dealt with.’ So, he resolved to make his favourite, the new
Archbishop; and this favourite was so extraordinary a man, and his
story is so curious, that I must tell you all about him.

Once upon a time, a worthy merchant of London, named Gilbert à Becket,
made a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, and was taken prisoner by a Saracen
lord. This lord, who treated him kindly and not like a slave, had one
fair daughter, who fell in love with the merchant; and who told him
that she wanted to become a Christian, and was willing to marry him if
they could fly to a Christian country. The merchant returned her love,
until he found an opportunity to escape, when he did not trouble
himself about the Saracen lady, but escaped with his servant Richard,
who had been taken prisoner along with him, and arrived in England and
forgot her. The Saracen lady, who was more loving than the merchant,
left her father’s house in disguise to follow him, and made her way,
under many hardships, to the sea-shore. The merchant had taught her
only two English words (for I suppose he must have learnt the Saracen
tongue himself, and made love in that language), of which London was
one, and his own name, Gilbert, the other. She went among the ships,
saying, ‘London! London!’ over and over again, until the sailors
understood that she wanted to find an English vessel that would carry
her there; so they showed her such a ship, and she paid for her passage
with some of her jewels, and sailed away. Well! The merchant was
sitting in his counting-house in London one day, when he heard a great
noise in the street; and presently Richard came running in from the
warehouse, with his eyes wide open and his breath almost gone, saying,
‘Master, master, here is the Saracen lady!’ The merchant thought
Richard was mad; but Richard said, ‘No, master! As I live, the Saracen
lady is going up and down the city, calling Gilbert! Gilbert!’ Then, he
took the merchant by the sleeve, and pointed out of window; and there
they saw her among the gables and water-spouts of the dark, dirty
street, in her foreign dress, so forlorn, surrounded by a wondering
crowd, and passing slowly along, calling Gilbert, Gilbert! When the
merchant saw her, and thought of the tenderness she had shown him in
his captivity, and of her constancy, his heart was moved, and he ran
down into the street; and she saw him coming, and with a great cry
fainted in his arms. They were married without loss of time, and
Richard (who was an excellent man) danced with joy the whole day of the
wedding; and they all lived happy ever afterwards.

This merchant and this Saracen lady had one son, Thomas à Becket. He it
was who became the Favourite of King Henry the Second.

He had become Chancellor, when the King thought of making him
Archbishop. He was clever, gay, well educated, brave; had fought in
several battles in France; had defeated a French knight in single
combat, and brought his horse away as a token of the victory. He lived
in a noble palace, he was the tutor of the young Prince Henry, he was
served by one hundred and forty knights, his riches were immense. The
King once sent him as his ambassador to France; and the French people,
beholding in what state he travelled, cried out in the streets, ‘How
splendid must the King of England be, when this is only the
Chancellor!’ They had good reason to wonder at the magnificence of
Thomas à Becket, for, when he entered a French town, his procession was
headed by two hundred and fifty singing boys; then, came his hounds in
couples; then, eight waggons, each drawn by five horses driven by five
drivers: two of the waggons filled with strong ale to be given away to
the people; four, with his gold and silver plate and stately clothes;
two, with the dresses of his numerous servants. Then, came twelve
horses, each with a monkey on his back; then, a train of people bearing
shields and leading fine war-horses splendidly equipped; then,
falconers with hawks upon their wrists; then, a host of knights, and
gentlemen and priests; then, the Chancellor with his brilliant garments
flashing in the sun, and all the people capering and shouting with
delight.

The King was well pleased with all this, thinking that it only made
himself the more magnificent to have so magnificent a favourite; but he
sometimes jested with the Chancellor upon his splendour too. Once, when
they were riding together through the streets of London in hard winter
weather, they saw a shivering old man in rags. ‘Look at the poor
object!’ said the King. ‘Would it not be a charitable act to give that
aged man a comfortable warm cloak?’ ‘Undoubtedly it would,’ said Thomas
à Becket, ‘and you do well, Sir, to think of such Christian duties.’
‘Come!’ cried the King, ‘then give him your cloak!’ It was made of rich
crimson trimmed with ermine. The King tried to pull it off, the
Chancellor tried to keep it on, both were near rolling from their
saddles in the mud, when the Chancellor submitted, and the King gave
the cloak to the old beggar: much to the beggar’s astonishment, and
much to the merriment of all the courtiers in attendance. For,
courtiers are not only eager to laugh when the King laughs, but they
really do enjoy a laugh against a Favourite.

‘I will make,’ thought King Henry the second, ‘this Chancellor of mine,
Thomas à Becket, Archbishop of Canterbury. He will then be the head of
the Church, and, being devoted to me, will help me to correct the
Church. He has always upheld my power against the power of the clergy,
and once publicly told some bishops (I remember), that men of the
Church were equally bound to me, with men of the sword. Thomas à Becket
is the man, of all other men in England, to help me in my great
design.’ So the King, regardless of all objection, either that he was a
fighting man, or a lavish man, or a courtly man, or a man of pleasure,
or anything but a likely man for the office, made him Archbishop
accordingly.

Now, Thomas à Becket was proud and loved to be famous. He was already
famous for the pomp of his life, for his riches, his gold and silver
plate, his waggons, horses, and attendants. He could do no more in that
way than he had done; and being tired of that kind of fame (which is a
very poor one), he longed to have his name celebrated for something
else. Nothing, he knew, would render him so famous in the world, as the
setting of his utmost power and ability against the utmost power and
ability of the King. He resolved with the whole strength of his mind to
do it.

He may have had some secret grudge against the King besides. The King
may have offended his proud humour at some time or other, for anything
I know. I think it likely, because it is a common thing for Kings,
Princes, and other great people, to try the tempers of their favourites
rather severely. Even the little affair of the crimson cloak must have
been anything but a pleasant one to a haughty man. Thomas à Becket knew
better than any one in England what the King expected of him. In all
his sumptuous life, he had never yet been in a position to disappoint
the King. He could take up that proud stand now, as head of the Church;
and he determined that it should be written in history, either that he
subdued the King, or that the King subdued him.

So, of a sudden, he completely altered the whole manner of his life. He
turned off all his brilliant followers, ate coarse food, drank bitter
water, wore next his skin sackcloth covered with dirt and vermin (for
it was then thought very religious to be very dirty), flogged his back
to punish himself, lived chiefly in a little cell, washed the feet of
thirteen poor people every day, and looked as miserable as he possibly
could. If he had put twelve hundred monkeys on horseback instead of
twelve, and had gone in procession with eight thousand waggons instead
of eight, he could not have half astonished the people so much as by
this great change. It soon caused him to be more talked about as an
Archbishop than he had been as a Chancellor.

The King was very angry; and was made still more so, when the new
Archbishop, claiming various estates from the nobles as being
rightfully Church property, required the King himself, for the same
reason, to give up Rochester Castle, and Rochester City too. Not
satisfied with this, he declared that no power but himself should
appoint a priest to any Church in the part of England over which he was
Archbishop; and when a certain gentleman of Kent made such an
appointment, as he claimed to have the right to do, Thomas à Becket
excommunicated him.

Excommunication was, next to the Interdict I told you of at the close
of the last chapter, the great weapon of the clergy. It consisted in
declaring the person who was excommunicated, an outcast from the Church
and from all religious offices; and in cursing him all over, from the
top of his head to the sole of his foot, whether he was standing up,
lying down, sitting, kneeling, walking, running, hopping, jumping,
gaping, coughing, sneezing, or whatever else he was doing. This
unchristian nonsense would of course have made no sort of difference to
the person cursed—who could say his prayers at home if he were shut out
of church, and whom none but God could judge—but for the fears and
superstitions of the people, who avoided excommunicated persons, and
made their lives unhappy. So, the King said to the New Archbishop,
‘Take off this Excommunication from this gentleman of Kent.’ To which
the Archbishop replied, ‘I shall do no such thing.’

The quarrel went on. A priest in Worcestershire committed a most
dreadful murder, that aroused the horror of the whole nation. The King
demanded to have this wretch delivered up, to be tried in the same
court and in the same way as any other murderer. The Archbishop
refused, and kept him in the Bishop’s prison. The King, holding a
solemn assembly in Westminster Hall, demanded that in future all
priests found guilty before their Bishops of crimes against the law of
the land should be considered priests no longer, and should be
delivered over to the law of the land for punishment. The Archbishop
again refused. The King required to know whether the clergy would obey
the ancient customs of the country? Every priest there, but one, said,
after Thomas à Becket, ‘Saving my order.’ This really meant that they
would only obey those customs when they did not interfere with their
own claims; and the King went out of the Hall in great wrath.

Some of the clergy began to be afraid, now, that they were going too
far. Though Thomas à Becket was otherwise as unmoved as Westminster
Hall, they prevailed upon him, for the sake of their fears, to go to
the King at Woodstock, and promise to observe the ancient customs of
the country, without saying anything about his order. The King received
this submission favourably, and summoned a great council of the clergy
to meet at the Castle of Clarendon, by Salisbury. But when the council
met, the Archbishop again insisted on the words ‘saying my order;’ and
he still insisted, though lords entreated him, and priests wept before
him and knelt to him, and an adjoining room was thrown open, filled
with armed soldiers of the King, to threaten him. At length he gave
way, for that time, and the ancient customs (which included what the
King had demanded in vain) were stated in writing, and were signed and
sealed by the chief of the clergy, and were called the Constitutions of
Clarendon.', 2526)

King. The King would not see him. The Archbishop tried to escape from
England. The sailors on the coast would launch no boat to take him
away. Then, he again resolved to do his worst in opposition to the
King, and began openly to set the ancient customs at defiance.

The King summoned him before a great council at Northampton, where he
accused him of high treason, and made a claim against him, which was
not a just one, for an enormous sum of money. Thomas à Becket was alone
against the whole assembly, and the very Bishops advised him to resign
his office and abandon his contest with the King. His great anxiety and
agitation stretched him on a sick-bed for two days, but he was still
undaunted. He went to the adjourned council, carrying a great cross in
his right hand, and sat down holding it erect before him. The King
angrily retired into an inner room. The whole assembly angrily retired
and left him there. But there he sat. The Bishops came out again in a
body, and renounced him as a traitor. He only said, ‘I hear!’ and sat
there still. They retired again into the inner room, and his trial
proceeded without him. By-and-by, the Earl of Leicester, heading the
barons, came out to read his sentence. He refused to hear it, denied
the power of the court, and said he would refer his cause to the Pope.
As he walked out of the hall, with the cross in his hand, some of those
present picked up rushes—rushes were strewn upon the floors in those
days by way of carpet—and threw them at him. He proudly turned his
head, and said that were he not Archbishop, he would chastise those
cowards with the sword he had known how to use in bygone days. He then
mounted his horse, and rode away, cheered and surrounded by the common
people, to whom he threw open his house that night and gave a supper,
supping with them himself. That same night he secretly departed from
the town; and so, travelling by night and hiding by day, and calling
himself ‘Brother Dearman,’ got away, not without difficulty, to
Flanders.

The struggle still went on. The angry King took possession of the
revenues of the archbishopric, and banished all the relations and
servants of Thomas à Becket, to the number of four hundred. The Pope
and the French King both protected him, and an abbey was assigned for
his residence. Stimulated by this support, Thomas à Becket, on a great
festival day, formally proceeded to a great church crowded with people,
and going up into the pulpit publicly cursed and excommunicated all who
had supported the Constitutions of Clarendon: mentioning many English
noblemen by name, and not distantly hinting at the King of England
himself.

When intelligence of this new affront was carried to the King in his
chamber, his passion was so furious that he tore his clothes, and
rolled like a madman on his bed of straw and rushes. But he was soon up
and doing. He ordered all the ports and coasts of England to be
narrowly watched, that no letters of Interdict might be brought into
the kingdom; and sent messengers and bribes to the Pope’s palace at
Rome. Meanwhile, Thomas à Becket, for his part, was not idle at Rome,
but constantly employed his utmost arts in his own behalf. Thus the
contest stood, until there was peace between France and England (which
had been for some time at war), and until the two children of the two
Kings were married in celebration of it. Then, the French King brought
about a meeting between Henry and his old favourite, so long his enemy.

Even then, though Thomas à Becket knelt before the King, he was
obstinate and immovable as to those words about his order. King Louis
of France was weak enough in his veneration for Thomas à Becket and
such men, but this was a little too much for him. He said that à Becket
‘wanted to be greater than the saints and better than St. Peter,’ and
rode away from him with the King of England. His poor French Majesty
asked à Becket’s pardon for so doing, however, soon afterwards, and cut
a very pitiful figure.

At last, and after a world of trouble, it came to this. There was
another meeting on French ground between King Henry and Thomas à
Becket, and it was agreed that Thomas à Becket should be Archbishop of
Canterbury, according to the customs of former Archbishops, and that
the King should put him in possession of the revenues of that post. And
now, indeed, you might suppose the struggle at an end, and Thomas à
Becket at rest. No, not even yet. For Thomas à Becket hearing, by some
means, that King Henry, when he was in dread of his kingdom being
placed under an interdict, had had his eldest son Prince Henry secretly
crowned, not only persuaded the Pope to suspend the Archbishop of York
who had performed that ceremony, and to excommunicate the Bishops who
had assisted at it, but sent a messenger of his own into England, in
spite of all the King’s precautions along the coast, who delivered the
letters of excommunication into the Bishops’ own hands. Thomas à Becket
then came over to England himself, after an absence of seven years. He
was privately warned that it was dangerous to come, and that an ireful
knight, named Ranulf de Broc, had threatened that he should not live to
eat a loaf of bread in England; but he came.

The common people received him well, and marched about with him in a
soldierly way, armed with such rustic weapons as they could get. He
tried to see the young prince who had once been his pupil, but was
prevented. He hoped for some little support among the nobles and
priests, but found none. He made the most of the peasants who attended
him, and feasted them, and went from Canterbury to Harrow-on-the-Hill,
and from Harrow-on-the-Hill back to Canterbury, and on Christmas Day
preached in the Cathedral there, and told the people in his sermon that
he had come to die among them, and that it was likely he would be
murdered. He had no fear, however—or, if he had any, he had much more
obstinacy—for he, then and there, excommunicated three of his enemies,
of whom Ranulf de Broc, the ireful knight, was one.

As men in general had no fancy for being cursed, in their sitting and
walking, and gaping and sneezing, and all the rest of it, it was very
natural in the persons so freely excommunicated to complain to the
King. It was equally natural in the King, who had hoped that this
troublesome opponent was at last quieted, to fall into a mighty rage
when he heard of these new affronts; and, on the Archbishop of York
telling him that he never could hope for rest while Thomas à Becket
lived, to cry out hastily before his court, ‘Have I no one here who
will deliver me from this man?’ There were four knights present, who,
hearing the King’s words, looked at one another, and went out.

The names of these knights were Reginald Fitzurse, William Tracy, Hugh
de Morville, and Richard Brito; three of whom had been in the train of
Thomas à Becket in the old days of his splendour. They rode away on
horseback, in a very secret manner, and on the third day after
Christmas Day arrived at Saltwood House, not far from Canterbury, which
belonged to the family of Ranulf de Broc. They quietly collected some
followers here, in case they should need any; and proceeding to
Canterbury, suddenly appeared (the four knights and twelve men) before
the Archbishop, in his own house, at two o’clock in the afternoon. They
neither bowed nor spoke, but sat down on the floor in silence, staring
at the Archbishop.

Thomas à Becket said, at length, ‘What do you want?’

‘We want,’ said Reginald Fitzurse, ‘the excommunication taken from the
Bishops, and you to answer for your offences to the King.’ Thomas à
Becket defiantly replied, that the power of the clergy was above the
power of the King. That it was not for such men as they were, to
threaten him. That if he were threatened by all the swords in England,
he would never yield.

‘Then we will do more than threaten!’ said the knights. And they went
out with the twelve men, and put on their armour, and drew their
shining swords, and came back.

His servants, in the meantime, had shut up and barred the great gate of
the palace. At first, the knights tried to shatter it with their
battle-axes; but, being shown a window by which they could enter, they
let the gate alone, and climbed in that way. While they were battering
at the door, the attendants of Thomas à Becket had implored him to take
refuge in the Cathedral; in which, as a sanctuary or sacred place, they
thought the knights would dare to do no violent deed. He told them,
again and again, that he would not stir. Hearing the distant voices of
the monks singing the evening service, however, he said it was now his
duty to attend, and therefore, and for no other reason, he would go.

There was a near way between his Palace and the Cathedral, by some
beautiful old cloisters which you may yet see. He went into the
Cathedral, without any hurry, and having the Cross carried before him
as usual. When he was safely there, his servants would have fastened
the door, but he said No! it was the house of God and not a fortress.

As he spoke, the shadow of Reginald Fitzurse appeared in the Cathedral
doorway, darkening the little light there was outside, on the dark
winter evening. This knight said, in a strong voice, ‘Follow me, loyal
servants of the King!’ The rattle of the armour of the other knights
echoed through the Cathedral, as they came clashing in.

It was so dark, in the lofty aisles and among the stately pillars of
the church, and there were so many hiding-places in the crypt below and
in the narrow passages above, that Thomas à Becket might even at that
pass have saved himself if he would. But he would not. He told the
monks resolutely that he would not. And though they all dispersed and
left him there with no other follower than Edward Gryme, his faithful
cross-bearer, he was as firm then, as ever he had been in his life.

The knights came on, through the darkness, making a terrible noise with
their armed tread upon the stone pavement of the church. ‘Where is the
traitor?’ they cried out. He made no answer. But when they cried,
‘Where is the Archbishop?’ he said proudly, ‘I am here!’ and came out
of the shade and stood before them.

The knights had no desire to kill him, if they could rid the King and
themselves of him by any other means. They told him he must either fly
or go with them. He said he would do neither; and he threw William
Tracy off with such force when he took hold of his sleeve, that Tracy
reeled again. By his reproaches and his steadiness, he so incensed
them, and exasperated their fierce humour, that Reginald Fitzurse, whom
he called by an ill name, said, ‘Then die!’ and struck at his head. But
the faithful Edward Gryme put out his arm, and there received the main
force of the blow, so that it only made his master bleed. Another voice
from among the knights again called to Thomas à Becket to fly; but,
with his blood running down his face, and his hands clasped, and his
head bent, he commanded himself to God, and stood firm. Then they
cruelly killed him close to the altar of St. Bennet; and his body fell
upon the pavement, which was dirtied with his blood and brains.

It is an awful thing to think of the murdered mortal, who had so
showered his curses about, lying, all disfigured, in the church, where
a few lamps here and there were but red specks on a pall of darkness;
and to think of the guilty knights riding away on horseback, looking
over their shoulders at the dim Cathedral, and remembering what they
had left inside.

PART THE SECOND

When the King heard how Thomas à Becket had lost his life in Canterbury
Cathedral, through the ferocity of the four Knights, he was filled with
dismay. Some have supposed that when the King spoke those hasty words,
‘Have I no one here who will deliver me from this man?’ he wished, and
meant à Becket to be slain. But few things are more unlikely; for,
besides that the King was not naturally cruel (though very passionate),
he was wise, and must have known full well what any stupid man in his
dominions must have known, namely, that such a murder would rouse the
Pope and the whole Church against him.

He sent respectful messengers to the Pope, to represent his innocence
(except in having uttered the hasty words); and he swore solemnly and
publicly to his innocence, and contrived in time to make his peace. As
to the four guilty Knights, who fled into Yorkshire, and never again
dared to show themselves at Court, the Pope excommunicated them; and
they lived miserably for some time, shunned by all their countrymen. At
last, they went humbly to Jerusalem as a penance, and there died and
were buried.

It happened, fortunately for the pacifying of the Pope, that an
opportunity arose very soon after the murder of à Becket, for the King
to declare his power in Ireland—which was an acceptable undertaking to
the Pope, as the Irish, who had been converted to Christianity by one
Patricius (otherwise Saint Patrick) long ago, before any Pope existed,
considered that the Pope had nothing at all to do with them, or they
with the Pope, and accordingly refused to pay him Peter’s Pence, or
that tax of a penny a house which I have elsewhere mentioned. The
King’s opportunity arose in this way.', 2415)

imagine. They were continually quarrelling and fighting, cutting one
another’s throats, slicing one another’s noses, burning one another’s
houses, carrying away one another’s wives, and committing all sorts of
violence. The country was divided into five kingdoms—Desmond, Thomond,
Connaught, Ulster, and Leinster—each governed by a separate King, of
whom one claimed to be the chief of the rest. Now, one of these Kings,
named Dermond Mac Murrough (a wild kind of name, spelt in more than one
wild kind of way), had carried off the wife of a friend of his, and
concealed her on an island in a bog. The friend resenting this (though
it was quite the custom of the country), complained to the chief King,
and, with the chief King’s help, drove Dermond Mac Murrough out of his
dominions. Dermond came over to England for revenge; and offered to
hold his realm as a vassal of King Henry, if King Henry would help him
to regain it. The King consented to these terms; but only assisted him,
then, with what were called Letters Patent, authorising any English
subjects who were so disposed, to enter into his service, and aid his
cause.

There was, at Bristol, a certain Earl Richard de Clare, called
Strongbow; of no very good character; needy and desperate, and ready
for anything that offered him a chance of improving his fortunes. There
were, in South Wales, two other broken knights of the same
good-for-nothing sort, called Robert Fitz-Stephen, and Maurice
Fitz-Gerald. These three, each with a small band of followers, took up
Dermond’s cause; and it was agreed that if it proved successful,
Strongbow should marry Dermond’s daughter Eva, and be declared his
heir.

The trained English followers of these knights were so superior in all
the discipline of battle to the Irish, that they beat them against
immense superiority of numbers. In one fight, early in the war, they
cut off three hundred heads, and laid them before Mac Murrough; who
turned them every one up with his hands, rejoicing, and, coming to one
which was the head of a man whom he had much disliked, grasped it by
the hair and ears, and tore off the nose and lips with his teeth. You
may judge from this, what kind of a gentleman an Irish King in those
times was. The captives, all through this war, were horribly treated;
the victorious party making nothing of breaking their limbs, and
casting them into the sea from the tops of high rocks. It was in the
midst of the miseries and cruelties attendant on the taking of
Waterford, where the dead lay piled in the streets, and the filthy
gutters ran with blood, that Strongbow married Eva. An odious
marriage-company those mounds of corpses must have made, I think, and
one quite worthy of the young lady’s father.

He died, after Waterford and Dublin had been taken, and various
successes achieved; and Strongbow became King of Leinster. Now came
King Henry’s opportunity. To restrain the growing power of Strongbow,
he himself repaired to Dublin, as Strongbow’s Royal Master, and
deprived him of his kingdom, but confirmed him in the enjoyment of
great possessions. The King, then, holding state in Dublin, received
the homage of nearly all the Irish Kings and Chiefs, and so came home
again with a great addition to his reputation as Lord of Ireland, and
with a new claim on the favour of the Pope. And now, their
reconciliation was completed—more easily and mildly by the Pope, than
the King might have expected, I think.

At this period of his reign, when his troubles seemed so few and his
prospects so bright, those domestic miseries began which gradually made
the King the most unhappy of men, reduced his great spirit, wore away
his health, and broke his heart.

He had four sons. Henry, now aged eighteen—his secret crowning of whom
had given such offence to Thomas à Becket. Richard, aged sixteen;
Geoffrey, fifteen; and John, his favourite, a young boy whom the
courtiers named Lackland, because he had no inheritance, but to whom
the King meant to give the Lordship of Ireland. All these misguided
boys, in their turn, were unnatural sons to him, and unnatural brothers
to each other. Prince Henry, stimulated by the French King, and by his
bad mother, Queen Eleanor, began the undutiful history.

First, he demanded that his young wife, Margaret, the French King’s
daughter, should be crowned as well as he. His father, the King,
consented, and it was done. It was no sooner done, than he demanded to
have a part of his father’s dominions, during his father’s life. This
being refused, he made off from his father in the night, with his bad
heart full of bitterness, and took refuge at the French King’s Court.
Within a day or two, his brothers Richard and Geoffrey followed. Their
mother tried to join them—escaping in man’s clothes—but she was seized
by King Henry’s men, and immured in prison, where she lay, deservedly,
for sixteen years. Every day, however, some grasping English noblemen,
to whom the King’s protection of his people from their avarice and
oppression had given offence, deserted him and joined the Princes.
Every day he heard some fresh intelligence of the Princes levying
armies against him; of Prince Henry’s wearing a crown before his own
ambassadors at the French Court, and being called the Junior King of
England; of all the Princes swearing never to make peace with him,
their father, without the consent and approval of the Barons of France.
But, with his fortitude and energy unshaken, King Henry met the shock
of these disasters with a resolved and cheerful face. He called upon
all Royal fathers who had sons, to help him, for his cause was theirs;
he hired, out of his riches, twenty thousand men to fight the false
French King, who stirred his own blood against him; and he carried on
the war with such vigour, that Louis soon proposed a conference to
treat for peace.

The conference was held beneath an old wide-spreading green elm-tree,
upon a plain in France. It led to nothing. The war recommenced. Prince
Richard began his fighting career, by leading an army against his
father; but his father beat him and his army back; and thousands of his
men would have rued the day in which they fought in such a wicked
cause, had not the King received news of an invasion of England by the
Scots, and promptly come home through a great storm to repress it. And
whether he really began to fear that he suffered these troubles because
à Becket had been murdered; or whether he wished to rise in the favour
of the Pope, who had now declared à Becket to be a saint, or in the
favour of his own people, of whom many believed that even à Becket’s
senseless tomb could work miracles, I don’t know: but the King no
sooner landed in England than he went straight to Canterbury; and when
he came within sight of the distant Cathedral, he dismounted from his
horse, took off his shoes, and walked with bare and bleeding feet to à
Becket’s grave. There, he lay down on the ground, lamenting, in the
presence of many people; and by-and-by he went into the Chapter House,
and, removing his clothes from his back and shoulders, submitted
himself to be beaten with knotted cords (not beaten very hard, I dare
say though) by eighty Priests, one after another. It chanced that on
the very day when the King made this curious exhibition of himself, a
complete victory was obtained over the Scots; which very much delighted
the Priests, who said that it was won because of his great example of
repentance. For the Priests in general had found out, since à Becket’s
death, that they admired him of all things—though they had hated him
very cordially when he was alive.

The Earl of Flanders, who was at the head of the base conspiracy of the
King’s undutiful sons and their foreign friends, took the opportunity
of the King being thus employed at home, to lay siege to Rouen, the
capital of Normandy. But the King, who was extraordinarily quick and
active in all his movements, was at Rouen, too, before it was supposed
possible that he could have left England; and there he so defeated the
said Earl of Flanders, that the conspirators proposed peace, and his
bad sons Henry and Geoffrey submitted. Richard resisted for six weeks;
but, being beaten out of castle after castle, he at last submitted too,
and his father forgave him.

To forgive these unworthy princes was only to afford them
breathing-time for new faithlessness. They were so false, disloyal, and
dishonourable, that they were no more to be trusted than common
thieves. In the very next year, Prince Henry rebelled again, and was
again forgiven. In eight years more, Prince Richard rebelled against
his elder brother; and Prince Geoffrey infamously said that the
brothers could never agree well together, unless they were united
against their father. In the very next year after their reconciliation
by the King, Prince Henry again rebelled against his father; and again
submitted, swearing to be true; and was again forgiven; and again
rebelled with Geoffrey.

But the end of this perfidious Prince was come. He fell sick at a
French town; and his conscience terribly reproaching him with his
baseness, he sent messengers to the King his father, imploring him to
come and see him, and to forgive him for the last time on his bed of
death. The generous King, who had a royal and forgiving mind towards
his children always, would have gone; but this Prince had been so
unnatural, that the noblemen about the King suspected treachery, and
represented to him that he could not safely trust his life with such a
traitor, though his own eldest son. Therefore the King sent him a ring
from off his finger as a token of forgiveness; and when the Prince had
kissed it, with much grief and many tears, and had confessed to those
around him how bad, and wicked, and undutiful a son he had been; he
said to the attendant Priests: ‘O, tie a rope about my body, and draw
me out of bed, and lay me down upon a bed of ashes, that I may die with
prayers to God in a repentant manner!’ And so he died, at twenty-seven
years old.

Three years afterwards, Prince Geoffrey, being unhorsed at a
tournament, had his brains trampled out by a crowd of horses passing
over him. So, there only remained Prince Richard, and Prince John—who
had grown to be a young man now, and had solemnly sworn to be faithful
to his father. Richard soon rebelled again, encouraged by his friend
the French King, Philip the Second (son of Louis, who was dead); and
soon submitted and was again forgiven, swearing on the New Testament
never to rebel again; and in another year or so, rebelled again; and,
in the presence of his father, knelt down on his knee before the King
of France; and did the French King homage: and declared that with his
aid he would possess himself, by force, of all his father’s French
dominions.

And yet this Richard called himself a soldier of Our Saviour! And yet
this Richard wore the Cross, which the Kings of France and England had
both taken, in the previous year, at a brotherly meeting underneath the
old wide-spreading elm-tree on the plain, when they had sworn (like
him) to devote themselves to a new Crusade, for the love and honour of
the Truth!

Sick at heart, wearied out by the falsehood of his sons, and almost
ready to lie down and die, the unhappy King who had so long stood firm,
began to fail. But the Pope, to his honour, supported him; and obliged
the French King and Richard, though successful in fight, to treat for
peace. Richard wanted to be Crowned King of England, and pretended that
he wanted to be married (which he really did not) to the French King’s
sister, his promised wife, whom King Henry detained in England. King
Henry wanted, on the other hand, that the French King’s sister should
be married to his favourite son, John: the only one of his sons (he
said) who had never rebelled against him. At last King Henry, deserted
by his nobles one by one, distressed, exhausted, broken-hearted,
consented to establish peace.

One final heavy sorrow was reserved for him, even yet. When they
brought him the proposed treaty of peace, in writing, as he lay very
ill in bed, they brought him also the list of the deserters from their
allegiance, whom he was required to pardon. The first name upon this
list was John, his favourite son, in whom he had trusted to the last.

‘O John! child of my heart!’ exclaimed the King, in a great agony of
mind. ‘O John, whom I have loved the best! O John, for whom I have
contended through these many troubles! Have you betrayed me too!’ And
then he lay down with a heavy groan, and said, ‘Now let the world go as
it will. I care for nothing more!’

After a time, he told his attendants to take him to the French town of
Chinon—a town he had been fond of, during many years. But he was fond
of no place now; it was too true that he could care for nothing more
upon this earth. He wildly cursed the hour when he was born, and cursed
the children whom he left behind him; and expired.

As, one hundred years before, the servile followers of the Court had
abandoned the Conqueror in the hour of his death, so they now abandoned
his descendant. The very body was stripped, in the plunder of the Royal
chamber; and it was not easy to find the means of carrying it for
burial to the abbey church of Fontevraud.

Richard was said in after years, by way of flattery, to have the heart
of a Lion. It would have been far better, I think, to have had the
heart of a Man. His heart, whatever it was, had cause to beat
remorsefully within his breast, when he came—as he did—into the solemn
abbey, and looked on his dead father’s uncovered face. His heart,
whatever it was, had been a black and perjured heart, in all its
dealings with the deceased King, and more deficient in a single touch
of tenderness than any wild beast’s in the forest.

There is a pretty story told of this Reign, called the story of Fair
Rosamond. It relates how the King doted on Fair Rosamond, who was the
loveliest girl in all the world; and how he had a beautiful Bower built
for her in a Park at Woodstock; and how it was erected in a labyrinth,
and could only be found by a clue of silk. How the bad Queen Eleanor,
becoming jealous of Fair Rosamond, found out the secret of the clue,
and one day, appeared before her, with a dagger and a cup of poison,
and left her to the choice between those deaths. How Fair Rosamond,
after shedding many piteous tears and offering many useless prayers to
the cruel Queen, took the poison, and fell dead in the midst of the
beautiful bower, while the unconscious birds sang gaily all around her.

Now, there _was_ a fair Rosamond, and she was (I dare say) the
loveliest girl in all the world, and the King was certainly very fond
of her, and the bad Queen Eleanor was certainly made jealous. But I am
afraid—I say afraid, because I like the story so much—that there was no
bower, no labyrinth, no silken clue, no dagger, no poison. I am afraid
fair Rosamond retired to a nunnery near Oxford, and died there,
peaceably; her sister-nuns hanging a silken drapery over her tomb, and
often dressing it with flowers, in remembrance of the youth and beauty
that had enchanted the King when he too was young, and when his life
lay fair before him.

It was dark and ended now; faded and gone. Henry Plantagenet lay quiet
in the abbey church of Fontevraud, in the fifty-seventh year of his
age—never to be completed—after governing England well, for nearly
thirty-five years.', 2760)

In the year of our Lord one thousand one hundred and eighty-nine,
Richard of the Lion Heart succeeded to the throne of King Henry the
Second, whose paternal heart he had done so much to break. He had been,
as we have seen, a rebel from his boyhood; but, the moment he became a
king against whom others might rebel, he found out that rebellion was a
great wickedness. In the heat of this pious discovery, he punished all
the leading people who had befriended him against his father. He could
scarcely have done anything that would have been a better instance of
his real nature, or a better warning to fawners and parasites not to
trust in lion-hearted princes.

He likewise put his late father’s treasurer in chains, and locked him
up in a dungeon from which he was not set free until he had
relinquished, not only all the Crown treasure, but all his own money
too. So, Richard certainly got the Lion’s share of the wealth of this
wretched treasurer, whether he had a Lion’s heart or not.

He was crowned King of England, with great pomp, at Westminster:
walking to the Cathedral under a silken canopy stretched on the tops of
four lances, each carried by a great lord. On the day of his
coronation, a dreadful murdering of the Jews took place, which seems to
have given great delight to numbers of savage persons calling
themselves Christians. The King had issued a proclamation forbidding
the Jews (who were generally hated, though they were the most useful
merchants in England) to appear at the ceremony; but as they had
assembled in London from all parts, bringing presents to show their
respect for the new Sovereign, some of them ventured down to
Westminster Hall with their gifts; which were very readily accepted. It
is supposed, now, that some noisy fellow in the crowd, pretending to be
a very delicate Christian, set up a howl at this, and struck a Jew who
was trying to get in at the Hall door with his present. A riot arose.
The Jews who had got into the Hall, were driven forth; and some of the
rabble cried out that the new King had commanded the unbelieving race
to be put to death. Thereupon the crowd rushed through the narrow
streets of the city, slaughtering all the Jews they met; and when they
could find no more out of doors (on account of their having fled to
their houses, and fastened themselves in), they ran madly about,
breaking open all the houses where the Jews lived, rushing in and
stabbing or spearing them, sometimes even flinging old people and
children out of window into blazing fires they had lighted up below.
This great cruelty lasted four-and-twenty hours, and only three men
were punished for it. Even they forfeited their lives not for murdering
and robbing the Jews, but for burning the houses of some Christians.

King Richard, who was a strong, restless, burly man, with one idea
always in his head, and that the very troublesome idea of breaking the
heads of other men, was mightily impatient to go on a Crusade to the
Holy Land, with a great army. As great armies could not be raised to
go, even to the Holy Land, without a great deal of money, he sold the
Crown domains, and even the high offices of State; recklessly
appointing noblemen to rule over his English subjects, not because they
were fit to govern, but because they could pay high for the privilege.
In this way, and by selling pardons at a dear rate and by varieties of
avarice and oppression, he scraped together a large treasure. He then
appointed two Bishops to take care of his kingdom in his absence, and
gave great powers and possessions to his brother John, to secure his
friendship. John would rather have been made Regent of England; but he
was a sly man, and friendly to the expedition; saying to himself, no
doubt, ‘The more fighting, the more chance of my brother being killed;
and when he _is_ killed, then I become King John!’

Before the newly levied army departed from England, the recruits and
the general populace distinguished themselves by astonishing cruelties
on the unfortunate Jews: whom, in many large towns, they murdered by
hundreds in the most horrible manner.

At York, a large body of Jews took refuge in the Castle, in the absence
of its Governor, after the wives and children of many of them had been
slain before their eyes. Presently came the Governor, and demanded
admission. ‘How can we give it thee, O Governor!’ said the Jews upon
the walls, ‘when, if we open the gate by so much as the width of a
foot, the roaring crowd behind thee will press in and kill us?’

Upon this, the unjust Governor became angry, and told the people that
he approved of their killing those Jews; and a mischievous maniac of a
friar, dressed all in white, put himself at the head of the assault,
and they assaulted the Castle for three days.

Then said Jocen, the head-Jew (who was a Rabbi or Priest), to the rest,
‘Brethren, there is no hope for us with the Christians who are
hammering at the gates and walls, and who must soon break in. As we and
our wives and children must die, either by Christian hands, or by our
own, let it be by our own. Let us destroy by fire what jewels and other
treasure we have here, then fire the castle, and then perish!’

A few could not resolve to do this, but the greater part complied. They
made a blazing heap of all their valuables, and, when those were
consumed, set the castle in flames. While the flames roared and
crackled around them, and shooting up into the sky, turned it
blood-red, Jocen cut the throat of his beloved wife, and stabbed
himself. All the others who had wives or children, did the like
dreadful deed. When the populace broke in, they found (except the
trembling few, cowering in corners, whom they soon killed) only heaps
of greasy cinders, with here and there something like part of the
blackened trunk of a burnt tree, but which had lately been a human
creature, formed by the beneficent hand of the Creator as they were.

After this bad beginning, Richard and his troops went on, in no very
good manner, with the Holy Crusade. It was undertaken jointly by the
King of England and his old friend Philip of France. They commenced the
business by reviewing their forces, to the number of one hundred
thousand men. Afterwards, they severally embarked their troops for
Messina, in Sicily, which was appointed as the next place of meeting.

King Richard’s sister had married the King of this place, but he was
dead: and his uncle Tancred had usurped the crown, cast the Royal Widow
into prison, and possessed himself of her estates. Richard fiercely
demanded his sister’s release, the restoration of her lands, and
(according to the Royal custom of the Island) that she should have a
golden chair, a golden table, four-and-twenty silver cups, and
four-and-twenty silver dishes. As he was too powerful to be
successfully resisted, Tancred yielded to his demands; and then the
French King grew jealous, and complained that the English King wanted
to be absolute in the Island of Messina and everywhere else. Richard,
however, cared little or nothing for this complaint; and in
consideration of a present of twenty thousand pieces of gold, promised
his pretty little nephew Arthur, then a child of two years old, in
marriage to Tancred’s daughter. We shall hear again of pretty little
Arthur by-and-by.

This Sicilian affair arranged without anybody’s brains being knocked
out (which must have rather disappointed him), King Richard took his
sister away, and also a fair lady named Berengaria, with whom he had
fallen in love in France, and whom his mother, Queen Eleanor (so long
in prison, you remember, but released by Richard on his coming to the
Throne), had brought out there to be his wife; and sailed with them for
Cyprus.

He soon had the pleasure of fighting the King of the Island of Cyprus,
for allowing his subjects to pillage some of the English troops who
were shipwrecked on the shore; and easily conquering this poor monarch,
he seized his only daughter, to be a companion to the lady Berengaria,
and put the King himself into silver fetters. He then sailed away again
with his mother, sister, wife, and the captive princess; and soon
arrived before the town of Acre, which the French King with his fleet
was besieging from the sea. But the French King was in no triumphant
condition, for his army had been thinned by the swords of the Saracens,
and wasted by the plague; and Saladin, the brave Sultan of the Turks,
at the head of a numerous army, was at that time gallantly defending
the place from the hills that rise above it.

Wherever the united army of Crusaders went, they agreed in few points
except in gaming, drinking, and quarrelling, in a most unholy manner;
in debauching the people among whom they tarried, whether they were
friends or foes; and in carrying disturbance and ruin into quiet
places. The French King was jealous of the English King, and the
English King was jealous of the French King, and the disorderly and
violent soldiers of the two nations were jealous of one another;
consequently, the two Kings could not at first agree, even upon a joint
assault on Acre; but when they did make up their quarrel for that
purpose, the Saracens promised to yield the town, to give up to the
Christians the wood of the Holy Cross, to set at liberty all their
Christian captives, and to pay two hundred thousand pieces of gold. All
this was to be done within forty days; but, not being done, King
Richard ordered some three thousand Saracen prisoners to be brought out
in the front of his camp, and there, in full view of their own
countrymen, to be butchered.', 1711)

travelling homeward with the greater part of his men; being offended by
the overbearing conduct of the English King; being anxious to look
after his own dominions; and being ill, besides, from the unwholesome
air of that hot and sandy country. King Richard carried on the war
without him; and remained in the East, meeting with a variety of
adventures, nearly a year and a half. Every night when his army was on
the march, and came to a halt, the heralds cried out three times, to
remind all the soldiers of the cause in which they were engaged, ‘Save
the Holy Sepulchre!’ and then all the soldiers knelt and said ‘Amen!’
Marching or encamping, the army had continually to strive with the hot
air of the glaring desert, or with the Saracen soldiers animated and
directed by the brave Saladin, or with both together. Sickness and
death, battle and wounds, were always among them; but through every
difficulty King Richard fought like a giant, and worked like a common
labourer. Long and long after he was quiet in his grave, his terrible
battle-axe, with twenty English pounds of English steel in its mighty
head, was a legend among the Saracens; and when all the Saracen and
Christian hosts had been dust for many a year, if a Saracen horse
started at any object by the wayside, his rider would exclaim, ‘What
dost thou fear, Fool? Dost thou think King Richard is behind it?’

No one admired this King’s renown for bravery more than Saladin
himself, who was a generous and gallant enemy. When Richard lay ill of
a fever, Saladin sent him fresh fruits from Damascus, and snow from the
mountain-tops. Courtly messages and compliments were frequently
exchanged between them—and then King Richard would mount his horse and
kill as many Saracens as he could; and Saladin would mount his, and
kill as many Christians as he could. In this way King Richard fought to
his heart’s content at Arsoof and at Jaffa; and finding himself with
nothing exciting to do at Ascalon, except to rebuild, for his own
defence, some fortifications there which the Saracens had destroyed, he
kicked his ally the Duke of Austria, for being too proud to work at
them.

The army at last came within sight of the Holy City of Jerusalem; but,
being then a mere nest of jealousy, and quarrelling and fighting, soon
retired, and agreed with the Saracens upon a truce for three years,
three months, three days, and three hours. Then, the English
Christians, protected by the noble Saladin from Saracen revenge,
visited Our Saviour’s tomb; and then King Richard embarked with a small
force at Acre to return home.

But he was shipwrecked in the Adriatic Sea, and was fain to pass
through Germany, under an assumed name. Now, there were many people in
Germany who had served in the Holy Land under that proud Duke of
Austria who had been kicked; and some of them, easily recognising a man
so remarkable as King Richard, carried their intelligence to the kicked
Duke, who straightway took him prisoner at a little inn near Vienna.

The Duke’s master the Emperor of Germany, and the King of France, were
equally delighted to have so troublesome a monarch in safe keeping.
Friendships which are founded on a partnership in doing wrong, are
never true; and the King of France was now quite as heartily King
Richard’s foe, as he had ever been his friend in his unnatural conduct
to his father. He monstrously pretended that King Richard had designed
to poison him in the East; he charged him with having murdered, there,
a man whom he had in truth befriended; he bribed the Emperor of Germany
to keep him close prisoner; and, finally, through the plotting of these
two princes, Richard was brought before the German legislature, charged
with the foregoing crimes, and many others. But he defended himself so
well, that many of the assembly were moved to tears by his eloquence
and earnestness. It was decided that he should be treated, during the
rest of his captivity, in a manner more becoming his dignity than he
had been, and that he should be set free on the payment of a heavy
ransom. This ransom the English people willingly raised. When Queen
Eleanor took it over to Germany, it was at first evaded and refused.
But she appealed to the honour of all the princes of the German Empire
in behalf of her son, and appealed so well that it was accepted, and
the King released. Thereupon, the King of France wrote to Prince
John—‘Take care of thyself. The devil is unchained!’

Prince John had reason to fear his brother, for he had been a traitor
to him in his captivity. He had secretly joined the French King; had
vowed to the English nobles and people that his brother was dead; and
had vainly tried to seize the crown. He was now in France, at a place
called Evreux. Being the meanest and basest of men, he contrived a mean
and base expedient for making himself acceptable to his brother. He
invited the French officers of the garrison in that town to dinner,
murdered them all, and then took the fortress. With this recommendation
to the good will of a lion-hearted monarch, he hastened to King
Richard, fell on his knees before him, and obtained the intercession of
Queen Eleanor. ‘I forgive him,’ said the King, ‘and I hope I may forget
the injury he has done me, as easily as I know he will forget my
pardon.’

While King Richard was in Sicily, there had been trouble in his
dominions at home: one of the bishops whom he had left in charge
thereof, arresting the other; and making, in his pride and ambition, as
great a show as if he were King himself. But the King hearing of it at
Messina, and appointing a new Regency, this Longchamp (for that was his
name) had fled to France in a woman’s dress, and had there been
encouraged and supported by the French King. With all these causes of
offence against Philip in his mind, King Richard had no sooner been
welcomed home by his enthusiastic subjects with great display and
splendour, and had no sooner been crowned afresh at Winchester, than he
resolved to show the French King that the Devil was unchained indeed,
and made war against him with great fury.

There was fresh trouble at home about this time, arising out of the
discontents of the poor people, who complained that they were far more
heavily taxed than the rich, and who found a spirited champion in
William Fitz-Osbert, called Longbeard. He became the leader of a secret
society, comprising fifty thousand men; he was seized by surprise; he
stabbed the citizen who first laid hands upon him; and retreated,
bravely fighting, to a church, which he maintained four days, until he
was dislodged by fire, and run through the body as he came out. He was
not killed, though; for he was dragged, half dead, at the tail of a
horse to Smithfield, and there hanged. Death was long a favourite
remedy for silencing the people’s advocates; but as we go on with this
history, I fancy we shall find them difficult to make an end of, for
all that.

The French war, delayed occasionally by a truce, was still in progress
when a certain Lord named Vidomar, Viscount of Limoges, chanced to find
in his ground a treasure of ancient coins. As the King’s vassal, he
sent the King half of it; but the King claimed the whole. The lord
refused to yield the whole. The King besieged the lord in his castle,
swore that he would take the castle by storm, and hang every man of its
defenders on the battlements.

There was a strange old song in that part of the country, to the effect
that in Limoges an arrow would be made by which King Richard would die.
It may be that Bertrand de Gourdon, a young man who was one of the
defenders of the castle, had often sung it or heard it sung of a winter
night, and remembered it when he saw, from his post upon the ramparts,
the King attended only by his chief officer riding below the walls
surveying the place. He drew an arrow to the head, took steady aim,
said between his teeth, ‘Now I pray God speed thee well, arrow!’
discharged it, and struck the King in the left shoulder.

Although the wound was not at first considered dangerous, it was severe
enough to cause the King to retire to his tent, and direct the assault
to be made without him. The castle was taken; and every man of its
defenders was hanged, as the King had sworn all should be, except
Bertrand de Gourdon, who was reserved until the royal pleasure
respecting him should be known.

By that time unskilful treatment had made the wound mortal and the King
knew that he was dying. He directed Bertrand to be brought into his
tent. The young man was brought there, heavily chained, King Richard
looked at him steadily. He looked, as steadily, at the King.

‘Knave!’ said King Richard. ‘What have I done to thee that thou
shouldest take my life?’

‘What hast thou done to me?’ replied the young man. ‘With thine own
hands thou hast killed my father and my two brothers. Myself thou
wouldest have hanged. Let me die now, by any torture that thou wilt. My
comfort is, that no torture can save Thee. Thou too must die; and,
through me, the world is quit of thee!’

Again the King looked at the young man steadily. Again the young man
looked steadily at him. Perhaps some remembrance of his generous enemy
Saladin, who was not a Christian, came into the mind of the dying King.

‘Youth!’ he said, ‘I forgive thee. Go unhurt!’ Then, turning to the
chief officer who had been riding in his company when he received the
wound, King Richard said:

‘Take off his chains, give him a hundred shillings, and let him
depart.’

He sunk down on his couch, and a dark mist seemed in his weakened eyes
to fill the tent wherein he had so often rested, and he died. His age
was forty-two; he had reigned ten years. His last command was not
obeyed; for the chief officer flayed Bertrand de Gourdon alive, and
hanged him.

There is an old tune yet known—a sorrowful air will sometimes outlive
many generations of strong men, and even last longer than battle-axes
with twenty pounds of steel in the head—by which this King is said to
have been discovered in his captivity. Blondel, a favourite Minstrel of
King Richard, as the story relates, faithfully seeking his Royal
master, went singing it outside the gloomy walls of many foreign
fortresses and prisons; until at last he heard it echoed from within a
dungeon, and knew the voice, and cried out in ecstasy, ‘O Richard, O my
King!’ You may believe it, if you like; it would be easy to believe
worse things. Richard was himself a Minstrel and a Poet. If he had not
been a Prince too, he might have been a better man perhaps, and might
have gone out of the world with less bloodshed and waste of life to
answer for.', 1928)

At two-and-thirty years of age, John became King of England. His pretty
little nephew Arthur had the best claim to the throne; but John seized
the treasure, and made fine promises to the nobility, and got himself
crowned at Westminster within a few weeks after his brother Richard’s
death. I doubt whether the crown could possibly have been put upon the
head of a meaner coward, or a more detestable villain, if England had
been searched from end to end to find him out.

The French King, Philip, refused to acknowledge the right of John to
his new dignity, and declared in favour of Arthur. You must not suppose
that he had any generosity of feeling for the fatherless boy; it merely
suited his ambitious schemes to oppose the King of England. So John and
the French King went to war about Arthur.

He was a handsome boy, at that time only twelve years old. He was not
born when his father, Geoffrey, had his brains trampled out at the
tournament; and, besides the misfortune of never having known a
father’s guidance and protection, he had the additional misfortune to
have a foolish mother (Constance by name), lately married to her third
husband. She took Arthur, upon John’s accession, to the French King,
who pretended to be very much his friend, and who made him a Knight,
and promised him his daughter in marriage; but, who cared so little
about him in reality, that finding it his interest to make peace with
King John for a time, he did so without the least consideration for the
poor little Prince, and heartlessly sacrificed all his interests.

Young Arthur, for two years afterwards, lived quietly; and in the
course of that time his mother died. But, the French King then finding
it his interest to quarrel with King John again, again made Arthur his
pretence, and invited the orphan boy to court. ‘You know your rights,
Prince,’ said the French King, ‘and you would like to be a King. Is it
not so?’ ‘Truly,’ said Prince Arthur, ‘I should greatly like to be a
King!’ ‘Then,’ said Philip, ‘you shall have two hundred gentlemen who
are Knights of mine, and with them you shall go to win back the
provinces belonging to you, of which your uncle, the usurping King of
England, has taken possession. I myself, meanwhile, will head a force
against him in Normandy.’ Poor Arthur was so flattered and so grateful
that he signed a treaty with the crafty French King, agreeing to
consider him his superior Lord, and that the French King should keep
for himself whatever he could take from King John.

Now, King John was so bad in all ways, and King Philip was so
perfidious, that Arthur, between the two, might as well have been a
lamb between a fox and a wolf. But, being so young, he was ardent and
flushed with hope; and, when the people of Brittany (which was his
inheritance) sent him five hundred more knights and five thousand foot
soldiers, he believed his fortune was made. The people of Brittany had
been fond of him from his birth, and had requested that he might be
called Arthur, in remembrance of that dimly-famous English Arthur, of
whom I told you early in this book, whom they believed to have been the
brave friend and companion of an old King of their own. They had tales
among them about a prophet called Merlin (of the same old time), who
had foretold that their own King should be restored to them after
hundreds of years; and they believed that the prophecy would be
fulfilled in Arthur; that the time would come when he would rule them
with a crown of Brittany upon his head; and when neither King of France
nor King of England would have any power over them. When Arthur found
himself riding in a glittering suit of armour on a richly caparisoned
horse, at the head of his train of knights and soldiers, he began to
believe this too, and to consider old Merlin a very superior prophet.

He did not know—how could he, being so innocent and inexperienced?—that
his little army was a mere nothing against the power of the King of
England. The French King knew it; but the poor boy’s fate was little to
him, so that the King of England was worried and distressed. Therefore,
King Philip went his way into Normandy and Prince Arthur went his way
towards Mirebeau, a French town near Poictiers, both very well pleased.

Prince Arthur went to attack the town of Mirebeau, because his
grandmother Eleanor, who has so often made her appearance in this
history (and who had always been his mother’s enemy), was living there,
and because his Knights said, ‘Prince, if you can take her prisoner,
you will be able to bring the King your uncle to terms!’ But she was
not to be easily taken. She was old enough by this time—eighty—but she
was as full of stratagem as she was full of years and wickedness.
Receiving intelligence of young Arthur’s approach, she shut herself up
in a high tower, and encouraged her soldiers to defend it like men.
Prince Arthur with his little army besieged the high tower. King John,
hearing how matters stood, came up to the rescue, with _his_ army. So
here was a strange family-party! The boy-Prince besieging his
grandmother, and his uncle besieging him!

This position of affairs did not last long. One summer night King John,
by treachery, got his men into the town, surprised Prince Arthur’s
force, took two hundred of his knights, and seized the Prince himself
in his bed. The Knights were put in heavy irons, and driven away in
open carts drawn by bullocks, to various dungeons where they were most
inhumanly treated, and where some of them were starved to death. Prince
Arthur was sent to the castle of Falaise.

One day, while he was in prison at that castle, mournfully thinking it
strange that one so young should be in so much trouble, and looking out
of the small window in the deep dark wall, at the summer sky and the
birds, the door was softly opened, and he saw his uncle the King
standing in the shadow of the archway, looking very grim.

‘Arthur,’ said the King, with his wicked eyes more on the stone floor
than on his nephew, ‘will you not trust to the gentleness, the
friendship, and the truthfulness of your loving uncle?’

‘I will tell my loving uncle that,’ replied the boy, ‘when he does me
right. Let him restore to me my kingdom of England, and then come to me
and ask the question.’

The King looked at him and went out. ‘Keep that boy close prisoner,’
said he to the warden of the castle.

Then, the King took secret counsel with the worst of his nobles how the
Prince was to be got rid of. Some said, ‘Put out his eyes and keep him
in prison, as Robort of Normandy was kept.’ Others said, ‘Have him
stabbed.’ Others, ‘Have him hanged.’ Others, ‘Have him poisoned.’

King John, feeling that in any case, whatever was done afterwards, it
would be a satisfaction to his mind to have those handsome eyes burnt
out that had looked at him so proudly while his own royal eyes were
blinking at the stone floor, sent certain ruffians to Falaise to blind
the boy with red-hot irons. But Arthur so pathetically entreated them,
and shed such piteous tears, and so appealed to Hubert de Bourg (or
Burgh), the warden of the castle, who had a love for him, and was an
honourable, tender man, that Hubert could not bear it. To his eternal
honour he prevented the torture from being performed, and, at his own
risk, sent the savages away.

The chafed and disappointed King bethought himself of the stabbing
suggestion next, and, with his shuffling manner and his cruel face,
proposed it to one William de Bray. ‘I am a gentleman and not an
executioner,’ said William de Bray, and left the presence with disdain.

But it was not difficult for a King to hire a murderer in those days.
King John found one for his money, and sent him down to the castle of
Falaise. ‘On what errand dost thou come?’ said Hubert to this fellow.
‘To despatch young Arthur,’ he returned. ‘Go back to him who sent
thee,’ answered Hubert, ‘and say that I will do it!’

King John very well knowing that Hubert would never do it, but that he
courageously sent this reply to save the Prince or gain time,
despatched messengers to convey the young prisoner to the castle of
Rouen.

Arthur was soon forced from the good Hubert—of whom he had never stood
in greater need than then—carried away by night, and lodged in his new
prison: where, through his grated window, he could hear the deep waters
of the river Seine, rippling against the stone wall below.

One dark night, as he lay sleeping, dreaming perhaps of rescue by those
unfortunate gentlemen who were obscurely suffering and dying in his
cause, he was roused, and bidden by his jailer to come down the
staircase to the foot of the tower. He hurriedly dressed himself and
obeyed. When they came to the bottom of the winding stairs, and the
night air from the river blew upon their faces, the jailer trod upon
his torch and put it out. Then, Arthur, in the darkness, was hurriedly
drawn into a solitary boat. And in that boat, he found his uncle and
one other man.

He knelt to them, and prayed them not to murder him. Deaf to his
entreaties, they stabbed him and sunk his body in the river with heavy
stones. When the spring-morning broke, the tower-door was closed, the
boat was gone, the river sparkled on its way, and never more was any
trace of the poor boy beheld by mortal eyes.

The news of this atrocious murder being spread in England, awakened a
hatred of the King (already odious for his many vices, and for his
having stolen away and married a noble lady while his own wife was
living) that never slept again through his whole reign. In Brittany,
the indignation was intense. Arthur’s own sister Eleanor was in the
power of John and shut up in a convent at Bristol, but his half-sister
Alice was in Brittany. The people chose her, and the murdered prince’s
father-in-law, the last husband of Constance, to represent them; and
carried their fiery complaints to King Philip. King Philip summoned
King John (as the holder of territory in France) to come before him and
defend himself. King John refusing to appear, King Philip declared him
false, perjured, and guilty; and again made war. In a little time, by
conquering the greater part of his French territory, King Philip
deprived him of one-third of his dominions. And, through all the
fighting that took place, King John was always found, either to be
eating and drinking, like a gluttonous fool, when the danger was at a
distance, or to be running away, like a beaten cur, when it was near.

You might suppose that when he was losing his dominions at this rate,
and when his own nobles cared so little for him or his cause that they
plainly refused to follow his banner out of England, he had enemies
enough. But he made another enemy of the Pope, which he did in this
way.

The Archbishop of Canterbury dying, and the junior monks of that place
wishing to get the start of the senior monks in the appointment of his
successor, met together at midnight, secretly elected a certain
Reginald, and sent him off to Rome to get the Pope’s approval. The
senior monks and the King soon finding this out, and being very angry
about it, the junior monks gave way, and all the monks together elected
the Bishop of Norwich, who was the King’s favourite. The Pope, hearing
the whole story, declared that neither election would do for him, and
that _he_ elected Stephen Langton. The monks submitting to the Pope,
the King turned them all out bodily, and banished them as traitors. The
Pope sent three bishops to the King, to threaten him with an Interdict.
The King told the bishops that if any Interdict were laid upon his
kingdom, he would tear out the eyes and cut off the noses of all the
monks he could lay hold of, and send them over to Rome in that
undecorated state as a present for their master. The bishops,
nevertheless, soon published the Interdict, and fled.

After it had lasted a year, the Pope proceeded to his next step; which
was Excommunication. King John was declared excommunicated, with all
the usual ceremonies. The King was so incensed at this, and was made so
desperate by the disaffection of his Barons and the hatred of his
people, that it is said he even privately sent ambassadors to the Turks
in Spain, offering to renounce his religion and hold his kingdom of
them if they would help him. It is related that the ambassadors were
admitted to the presence of the Turkish Emir through long lines of
Moorish guards, and that they found the Emir with his eyes seriously
fixed on the pages of a large book, from which he never once looked up.
That they gave him a letter from the King containing his proposals, and
were gravely dismissed. That presently the Emir sent for one of them,
and conjured him, by his faith in his religion, to say what kind of man
the King of England truly was? That the ambassador, thus pressed,
replied that the King of England was a false tyrant, against whom his
own subjects would soon rise. And that this was quite enough for the
Emir.', 2339)

spared no means of getting it. He set on foot another oppressing and
torturing of the unhappy Jews (which was quite in his way), and
invented a new punishment for one wealthy Jew of Bristol. Until such
time as that Jew should produce a certain large sum of money, the King
sentenced him to be imprisoned, and, every day, to have one tooth
violently wrenched out of his head—beginning with the double teeth. For
seven days, the oppressed man bore the daily pain and lost the daily
tooth; but, on the eighth, he paid the money. With the treasure raised
in such ways, the King made an expedition into Ireland, where some
English nobles had revolted. It was one of the very few places from
which he did not run away; because no resistance was shown. He made
another expedition into Wales—whence he _did_ run away in the end: but
not before he had got from the Welsh people, as hostages, twenty-seven
young men of the best families; every one of whom he caused to be slain
in the following year.

To Interdict and Excommunication, the Pope now added his last sentence;
Deposition. He proclaimed John no longer King, absolved all his
subjects from their allegiance, and sent Stephen Langton and others to
the King of France to tell him that, if he would invade England, he
should be forgiven all his sins—at least, should be forgiven them by
the Pope, if that would do.

As there was nothing that King Philip desired more than to invade
England, he collected a great army at Rouen, and a fleet of seventeen
hundred ships to bring them over. But the English people, however
bitterly they hated the King, were not a people to suffer invasion
quietly. They flocked to Dover, where the English standard was, in such
great numbers to enrol themselves as defenders of their native land,
that there were not provisions for them, and the King could only select
and retain sixty thousand. But, at this crisis, the Pope, who had his
own reasons for objecting to either King John or King Philip being too
powerful, interfered. He entrusted a legate, whose name was Pandolf,
with the easy task of frightening King John. He sent him to the English
Camp, from France, to terrify him with exaggerations of King Philip’s
power, and his own weakness in the discontent of the English Barons and
people. Pandolf discharged his commission so well, that King John, in a
wretched panic, consented to acknowledge Stephen Langton; to resign his
kingdom ‘to God, Saint Peter, and Saint Paul’—which meant the Pope; and
to hold it, ever afterwards, by the Pope’s leave, on payment of an
annual sum of money. To this shameful contract he publicly bound
himself in the church of the Knights Templars at Dover: where he laid
at the legate’s feet a part of the tribute, which the legate haughtily
trampled upon. But they _do_ say, that this was merely a genteel
flourish, and that he was afterwards seen to pick it up and pocket it.

There was an unfortunate prophet, the name of Peter, who had greatly
increased King John’s terrors by predicting that he would be unknighted
(which the King supposed to signify that he would die) before the Feast
of the Ascension should be past. That was the day after this
humiliation. When the next morning came, and the King, who had been
trembling all night, found himself alive and safe, he ordered the
prophet—and his son too—to be dragged through the streets at the tails
of horses, and then hanged, for having frightened him.

As King John had now submitted, the Pope, to King Philip’s great
astonishment, took him under his protection, and informed King Philip
that he found he could not give him leave to invade England. The angry
Philip resolved to do it without his leave but he gained nothing and
lost much; for, the English, commanded by the Earl of Salisbury, went
over, in five hundred ships, to the French coast, before the French
fleet had sailed away from it, and utterly defeated the whole.

The Pope then took off his three sentences, one after another, and
empowered Stephen Langton publicly to receive King John into the favour
of the Church again, and to ask him to dinner. The King, who hated
Langton with all his might and main—and with reason too, for he was a
great and a good man, with whom such a King could have no
sympathy—pretended to cry and to be _very_ grateful. There was a little
difficulty about settling how much the King should pay as a recompense
to the clergy for the losses he had caused them; but, the end of it
was, that the superior clergy got a good deal, and the inferior clergy
got little or nothing—which has also happened since King John’s time, I
believe.

When all these matters were arranged, the King in his triumph became
more fierce, and false, and insolent to all around him than he had ever
been. An alliance of sovereigns against King Philip, gave him an
opportunity of landing an army in France; with which he even took a
town! But, on the French King’s gaining a great victory, he ran away,
of course, and made a truce for five years.

And now the time approached when he was to be still further humbled,
and made to feel, if he could feel anything, what a wretched creature
he was. Of all men in the world, Stephen Langton seemed raised up by
Heaven to oppose and subdue him. When he ruthlessly burnt and destroyed
the property of his own subjects, because their Lords, the Barons,
would not serve him abroad, Stephen Langton fearlessly reproved and
threatened him. When he swore to restore the laws of King Edward, or
the laws of King Henry the First, Stephen Langton knew his falsehood,
and pursued him through all his evasions. When the Barons met at the
abbey of Saint Edmund’s-Bury, to consider their wrongs and the King’s
oppressions, Stephen Langton roused them by his fervid words to demand
a solemn charter of rights and liberties from their perjured master,
and to swear, one by one, on the High Altar, that they would have it,
or would wage war against him to the death. When the King hid himself
in London from the Barons, and was at last obliged to receive them,
they told him roundly they would not believe him unless Stephen Langton
became a surety that he would keep his word. When he took the Cross to
invest himself with some interest, and belong to something that was
received with favour, Stephen Langton was still immovable. When he
appealed to the Pope, and the Pope wrote to Stephen Langton in behalf
of his new favourite, Stephen Langton was deaf, even to the Pope
himself, and saw before him nothing but the welfare of England and the
crimes of the English King.

At Easter-time, the Barons assembled at Stamford, in Lincolnshire, in
proud array, and, marching near to Oxford where the King was, delivered
into the hands of Stephen Langton and two others, a list of grievances.
‘And these,’ they said, ‘he must redress, or we will do it for
ourselves!’ When Stephen Langton told the King as much, and read the
list to him, he went half mad with rage. But that did him no more good
than his afterwards trying to pacify the Barons with lies. They called
themselves and their followers, ‘The army of God and the Holy Church.’
Marching through the country, with the people thronging to them
everywhere (except at Northampton, where they failed in an attack upon
the castle), they at last triumphantly set up their banner in London
itself, whither the whole land, tired of the tyrant, seemed to flock to
join them. Seven knights alone, of all the knights in England, remained
with the King; who, reduced to this strait, at last sent the Earl of
Pembroke to the Barons to say that he approved of everything, and would
meet them to sign their charter when they would. ‘Then,’ said the
Barons, ‘let the day be the fifteenth of June, and the place,
Runny-Mead.’

On Monday, the fifteenth of June, one thousand two hundred and
fourteen, the King came from Windsor Castle, and the Barons came from
the town of Staines, and they met on Runny-Mead, which is still a
pleasant meadow by the Thames, where rushes grow in the clear water of
the winding river, and its banks are green with grass and trees. On the
side of the Barons, came the General of their army, Robert Fitz-Walter,
and a great concourse of the nobility of England. With the King, came,
in all, some four-and-twenty persons of any note, most of whom despised
him, and were merely his advisers in form. On that great day, and in
that great company, the King signed Magna Charta—the great charter of
England—by which he pledged himself to maintain the Church in its
rights; to relieve the Barons of oppressive obligations as vassals of
the Crown—of which the Barons, in their turn, pledged themselves to
relieve _their_ vassals, the people; to respect the liberties of London
and all other cities and boroughs; to protect foreign merchants who
came to England; to imprison no man without a fair trial; and to sell,
delay, or deny justice to none. As the Barons knew his falsehood well,
they further required, as their securities, that he should send out of
his kingdom all his foreign troops; that for two months they should
hold possession of the city of London, and Stephen Langton of the
Tower; and that five-and-twenty of their body, chosen by themselves,
should be a lawful committee to watch the keeping of the charter, and
to make war upon him if he broke it.

All this he was obliged to yield. He signed the charter with a smile,
and, if he could have looked agreeable, would have done so, as he
departed from the splendid assembly. When he got home to Windsor
Castle, he was quite a madman in his helpless fury. And he broke the
charter immediately afterwards.

He sent abroad for foreign soldiers, and sent to the Pope for help, and
plotted to take London by surprise, while the Barons should be holding
a great tournament at Stamford, which they had agreed to hold there as
a celebration of the charter. The Barons, however, found him out and
put it off. Then, when the Barons desired to see him and tax him with
his treachery, he made numbers of appointments with them, and kept
none, and shifted from place to place, and was constantly sneaking and
skulking about. At last he appeared at Dover, to join his foreign
soldiers, of whom numbers came into his pay; and with them he besieged
and took Rochester Castle, which was occupied by knights and soldiers
of the Barons. He would have hanged them every one; but the leader of
the foreign soldiers, fearful of what the English people might
afterwards do to him, interfered to save the knights; therefore the
King was fain to satisfy his vengeance with the death of all the common
men. Then, he sent the Earl of Salisbury, with one portion of his army,
to ravage the eastern part of his own dominions, while he carried fire
and slaughter into the northern part; torturing, plundering, killing,
and inflicting every possible cruelty upon the people; and, every
morning, setting a worthy example to his men by setting fire, with his
own monster-hands, to the house where he had slept last night. Nor was
this all; for the Pope, coming to the aid of his precious friend, laid
the kingdom under an Interdict again, because the people took part with
the Barons. It did not much matter, for the people had grown so used to
it now, that they had begun to think nothing about it. It occurred to
them—perhaps to Stephen Langton too—that they could keep their churches
open, and ring their bells, without the Pope’s permission as well as
with it. So, they tried the experiment—and found that it succeeded
perfectly.

It being now impossible to bear the country, as a wilderness of
cruelty, or longer to hold any terms with such a forsworn outlaw of a
King, the Barons sent to Louis, son of the French monarch, to offer him
the English crown. Caring as little for the Pope’s excommunication of
him if he accepted the offer, as it is possible his father may have
cared for the Pope’s forgiveness of his sins, he landed at Sandwich
(King John immediately running away from Dover, where he happened to
be), and went on to London. The Scottish King, with whom many of the
Northern English Lords had taken refuge, numbers of the foreign
soldiers, numbers of the Barons, and numbers of the people went over to
him every day;—King John, the while, continually running away in all
directions.

The career of Louis was checked however, by the suspicions of the
Barons, founded on the dying declaration of a French Lord, that when
the kingdom was conquered he was sworn to banish them as traitors, and
to give their estates to some of his own Nobles. Rather than suffer
this, some of the Barons hesitated: others even went over to King John.

It seemed to be the turning-point of King John’s fortunes, for, in his
savage and murderous course, he had now taken some towns and met with
some successes. But, happily for England and humanity, his death was
near. Crossing a dangerous quicksand, called the Wash, not very far
from Wisbeach, the tide came up and nearly drowned his army. He and his
soldiers escaped; but, looking back from the shore when he was safe, he
saw the roaring water sweep down in a torrent, overturn the waggons,
horses, and men, that carried his treasure, and engulf them in a raging
whirlpool from which nothing could be delivered.

Cursing, and swearing, and gnawing his fingers, he went on to
Swinestead Abbey, where the monks set before him quantities of pears,
and peaches, and new cider—some say poison too, but there is very
little reason to suppose so—of which he ate and drank in an immoderate
and beastly way. All night he lay ill of a burning fever, and haunted
with horrible fears. Next day, they put him in a horse-litter, and
carried him to Sleaford Castle, where he passed another night of pain
and horror. Next day, they carried him, with greater difficulty than on
the day before, to the castle of Newark upon Trent; and there, on the
eighteenth of October, in the forty-ninth year of his age, and the
seventeenth of his vile reign, was an end of this miserable brute.', 2497)

If any of the English Barons remembered the murdered Arthur’s sister,
Eleanor the fair maid of Brittany, shut up in her convent at Bristol,
none among them spoke of her now, or maintained her right to the Crown.
The dead Usurper’s eldest boy, Henry by name, was taken by the Earl of
Pembroke, the Marshal of England, to the city of Gloucester, and there
crowned in great haste when he was only ten years old. As the Crown
itself had been lost with the King’s treasure in the raging water, and
as there was no time to make another, they put a circle of plain gold
upon his head instead. ‘We have been the enemies of this child’s
father,’ said Lord Pembroke, a good and true gentleman, to the few
Lords who were present, ‘and he merited our ill-will; but the child
himself is innocent, and his youth demands our friendship and
protection.’ Those Lords felt tenderly towards the little boy,
remembering their own young children; and they bowed their heads, and
said, ‘Long live King Henry the Third!’

Next, a great council met at Bristol, revised Magna Charta, and made
Lord Pembroke Regent or Protector of England, as the King was too young
to reign alone. The next thing to be done, was to get rid of Prince
Louis of France, and to win over those English Barons who were still
ranged under his banner. He was strong in many parts of England, and in
London itself; and he held, among other places, a certain Castle called
the Castle of Mount Sorel, in Leicestershire. To this fortress, after
some skirmishing and truce-making, Lord Pembroke laid siege. Louis
despatched an army of six hundred knights and twenty thousand soldiers
to relieve it. Lord Pembroke, who was not strong enough for such a
force, retired with all his men. The army of the French Prince, which
had marched there with fire and plunder, marched away with fire and
plunder, and came, in a boastful swaggering manner, to Lincoln. The
town submitted; but the Castle in the town, held by a brave widow lady,
named Nichola de Camville (whose property it was), made such a sturdy
resistance, that the French Count in command of the army of the French
Prince found it necessary to besiege this Castle. While he was thus
engaged, word was brought to him that Lord Pembroke, with four hundred
knights, two hundred and fifty men with cross-bows, and a stout force
both of horse and foot, was marching towards him. ‘What care I?’ said
the French Count. ‘The Englishman is not so mad as to attack me and my
great army in a walled town!’ But the Englishman did it for all that,
and did it—not so madly but so wisely, that he decoyed the great army
into the narrow, ill-paved lanes and byways of Lincoln, where its
horse-soldiers could not ride in any strong body; and there he made
such havoc with them, that the whole force surrendered themselves
prisoners, except the Count; who said that he would never yield to any
English traitor alive, and accordingly got killed. The end of this
victory, which the English called, for a joke, the Fair of Lincoln, was
the usual one in those times—the common men were slain without any
mercy, and the knights and gentlemen paid ransom and went home.

The wife of Louis, the fair Blanche of Castile, dutifully equipped a
fleet of eighty good ships, and sent it over from France to her
husband’s aid. An English fleet of forty ships, some good and some bad,
gallantly met them near the mouth of the Thames, and took or sunk
sixty-five in one fight. This great loss put an end to the French
Prince’s hopes. A treaty was made at Lambeth, in virtue of which the
English Barons who had remained attached to his cause returned to their
allegiance, and it was engaged on both sides that the Prince and all
his troops should retire peacefully to France. It was time to go; for
war had made him so poor that he was obliged to borrow money from the
citizens of London to pay his expenses home.

Lord Pembroke afterwards applied himself to governing the country
justly, and to healing the quarrels and disturbances that had arisen
among men in the days of the bad King John. He caused Magna Charta to
be still more improved, and so amended the Forest Laws that a Peasant
was no longer put to death for killing a stag in a Royal Forest, but
was only imprisoned. It would have been well for England if it could
have had so good a Protector many years longer, but that was not to be.
Within three years after the young King’s Coronation, Lord Pembroke
died; and you may see his tomb, at this day, in the old Temple Church
in London.

The Protectorship was now divided. Peter de Roches, whom King John had
made Bishop of Winchester, was entrusted with the care of the person of
the young sovereign; and the exercise of the Royal authority was
confided to Earl Hubert de Burgh. These two personages had from the
first no liking for each other, and soon became enemies. When the young
King was declared of age, Peter de Roches, finding that Hubert
increased in power and favour, retired discontentedly, and went abroad.
For nearly ten years afterwards Hubert had full sway alone.

But ten years is a long time to hold the favour of a King. This King,
too, as he grew up, showed a strong resemblance to his father, in
feebleness, inconsistency, and irresolution. The best that can be said
of him is that he was not cruel. De Roches coming home again, after ten
years, and being a novelty, the King began to favour him and to look
coldly on Hubert. Wanting money besides, and having made Hubert rich,
he began to dislike Hubert. At last he was made to believe, or
pretended to believe, that Hubert had misappropriated some of the Royal
treasure; and ordered him to furnish an account of all he had done in
his administration. Besides which, the foolish charge was brought
against Hubert that he had made himself the King’s favourite by magic.
Hubert very well knowing that he could never defend himself against
such nonsense, and that his old enemy must be determined on his ruin,
instead of answering the charges fled to Merton Abbey. Then the King,
in a violent passion, sent for the Mayor of London, and said to the
Mayor, ‘Take twenty thousand citizens, and drag me Hubert de Burgh out
of that abbey, and bring him here.’ The Mayor posted off to do it, but
the Archbishop of Dublin (who was a friend of Hubert’s) warning the
King that an abbey was a sacred place, and that if he committed any
violence there, he must answer for it to the Church, the King changed
his mind and called the Mayor back, and declared that Hubert should
have four months to prepare his defence, and should be safe and free
during that time.

Hubert, who relied upon the King’s word, though I think he was old
enough to have known better, came out of Merton Abbey upon these
conditions, and journeyed away to see his wife: a Scottish Princess who
was then at St. Edmund’s-Bury.

Almost as soon as he had departed from the Sanctuary, his enemies
persuaded the weak King to send out one Sir Godfrey de Crancumb, who
commanded three hundred vagabonds called the Black Band, with orders to
seize him. They came up with him at a little town in Essex, called
Brentwood, when he was in bed. He leaped out of bed, got out of the
house, fled to the church, ran up to the altar, and laid his hand upon
the cross. Sir Godfrey and the Black Band, caring neither for church,
altar, nor cross, dragged him forth to the church door, with their
drawn swords flashing round his head, and sent for a Smith to rivet a
set of chains upon him. When the Smith (I wish I knew his name!) was
brought, all dark and swarthy with the smoke of his forge, and panting
with the speed he had made; and the Black Band, falling aside to show
him the Prisoner, cried with a loud uproar, ‘Make the fetters heavy!
make them strong!’ the Smith dropped upon his knee—but not to the Black
Band—and said, ‘This is the brave Earl Hubert de Burgh, who fought at
Dover Castle, and destroyed the French fleet, and has done his country
much good service. You may kill me, if you like, but I will never make
a chain for Earl Hubert de Burgh!’

The Black Band never blushed, or they might have blushed at this. They
knocked the Smith about from one to another, and swore at him, and tied
the Earl on horseback, undressed as he was, and carried him off to the
Tower of London. The Bishops, however, were so indignant at the
violation of the Sanctuary of the Church, that the frightened King soon
ordered the Black Band to take him back again; at the same time
commanding the Sheriff of Essex to prevent his escaping out of
Brentwood Church. Well! the Sheriff dug a deep trench all round the
church, and erected a high fence, and watched the church night and day;
the Black Band and their Captain watched it too, like three hundred and
one black wolves. For thirty-nine days, Hubert de Burgh remained
within. At length, upon the fortieth day, cold and hunger were too much
for him, and he gave himself up to the Black Band, who carried him off,
for the second time, to the Tower. When his trial came on, he refused
to plead; but at last it was arranged that he should give up all the
royal lands which had been bestowed upon him, and should be kept at the
Castle of Devizes, in what was called ‘free prison,’ in charge of four
knights appointed by four lords. There, he remained almost a year,
until, learning that a follower of his old enemy the Bishop was made
Keeper of the Castle, and fearing that he might be killed by treachery,
he climbed the ramparts one dark night, dropped from the top of the
high Castle wall into the moat, and coming safely to the ground, took
refuge in another church. From this place he was delivered by a party
of horse despatched to his help by some nobles, who were by this time
in revolt against the King, and assembled in Wales. He was finally
pardoned and restored to his estates, but he lived privately, and never
more aspired to a high post in the realm, or to a high place in the
King’s favour. And thus end—more happily than the stories of many
favourites of Kings—the adventures of Earl Hubert de Burgh.

The nobles, who had risen in revolt, were stirred up to rebellion by
the overbearing conduct of the Bishop of Winchester, who, finding that
the King secretly hated the Great Charter which had been forced from
his father, did his utmost to confirm him in that dislike, and in the
preference he showed to foreigners over the English. Of this, and of
his even publicly declaring that the Barons of England were inferior to
those of France, the English Lords complained with such bitterness,
that the King, finding them well supported by the clergy, became
frightened for his throne, and sent away the Bishop and all his foreign
associates. On his marriage, however, with Eleanor, a French lady, the
daughter of the Count of Provence, he openly favoured the foreigners
again; and so many of his wife’s relations came over, and made such an
immense family-party at court, and got so many good things, and
pocketed so much money, and were so high with the English whose money
they pocketed, that the bolder English Barons murmured openly about a
clause there was in the Great Charter, which provided for the
banishment of unreasonable favourites. But, the foreigners only laughed
disdainfully, and said, ‘What are your English laws to us?’

King Philip of France had died, and had been succeeded by Prince Louis,
who had also died after a short reign of three years, and had been
succeeded by his son of the same name—so moderate and just a man that
he was not the least in the world like a King, as Kings went. Isabella,
King Henry’s mother, wished very much (for a certain spite she had)
that England should make war against this King; and, as King Henry was
a mere puppet in anybody’s hands who knew how to manage his feebleness,
she easily carried her point with him. But, the Parliament were
determined to give him no money for such a war. So, to defy the
Parliament, he packed up thirty large casks of silver—I don’t know how
he got so much; I dare say he screwed it out of the miserable Jews—and
put them aboard ship, and went away himself to carry war into France:
accompanied by his mother and his brother Richard, Earl of Cornwall,
who was rich and clever. But he only got well beaten, and came home.

The good-humour of the Parliament was not restored by this. They
reproached the King with wasting the public money to make greedy
foreigners rich, and were so stern with him, and so determined not to
let him have more of it to waste if they could help it, that he was at
his wit’s end for some, and tried so shamelessly to get all he could
from his subjects, by excuses or by force, that the people used to say
the King was the sturdiest beggar in England. He took the Cross,
thinking to get some money by that means; but, as it was very well
known that he never meant to go on a crusade, he got none. In all this
contention, the Londoners were particularly keen against the King, and
the King hated them warmly in return. Hating or loving, however, made
no difference; he continued in the same condition for nine or ten
years, when at last the Barons said that if he would solemnly confirm
their liberties afresh, the Parliament would vote him a large sum.

As he readily consented, there was a great meeting held in Westminster
Hall, one pleasant day in May, when all the clergy, dressed in their
robes and holding every one of them a burning candle in his hand, stood
up (the Barons being also there) while the Archbishop of Canterbury
read the sentence of excommunication against any man, and all men, who
should henceforth, in any way, infringe the Great Charter of the
Kingdom. When he had done, they all put out their burning candles with
a curse upon the soul of any one, and every one, who should merit that
sentence. The King concluded with an oath to keep the Charter, ‘As I am
a man, as I am a Christian, as I am a Knight, as I am a King!’', 2549)

both, as his father had done before him. He took to his old courses
again when he was supplied with money, and soon cured of their weakness
the few who had ever really trusted him. When his money was gone, and
he was once more borrowing and begging everywhere with a meanness
worthy of his nature, he got into a difficulty with the Pope respecting
the Crown of Sicily, which the Pope said he had a right to give away,
and which he offered to King Henry for his second son, Prince Edmund.
But, if you or I give away what we have not got, and what belongs to
somebody else, it is likely that the person to whom we give it, will
have some trouble in taking it. It was exactly so in this case. It was
necessary to conquer the Sicilian Crown before it could be put upon
young Edmund’s head. It could not be conquered without money. The Pope
ordered the clergy to raise money. The clergy, however, were not so
obedient to him as usual; they had been disputing with him for some
time about his unjust preference of Italian Priests in England; and
they had begun to doubt whether the King’s chaplain, whom he allowed to
be paid for preaching in seven hundred churches, could possibly be,
even by the Pope’s favour, in seven hundred places at once. ‘The Pope
and the King together,’ said the Bishop of London, ‘may take the mitre
off my head; but, if they do, they will find that I shall put on a
soldier’s helmet. I pay nothing.’ The Bishop of Worcester was as bold
as the Bishop of London, and would pay nothing either. Such sums as the
more timid or more helpless of the clergy did raise were squandered
away, without doing any good to the King, or bringing the Sicilian
Crown an inch nearer to Prince Edmund’s head. The end of the business
was, that the Pope gave the Crown to the brother of the King of France
(who conquered it for himself), and sent the King of England in, a bill
of one hundred thousand pounds for the expenses of not having won it.

The King was now so much distressed that we might almost pity him, if
it were possible to pity a King so shabby and ridiculous. His clever
brother, Richard, had bought the title of King of the Romans from the
German people, and was no longer near him, to help him with advice. The
clergy, resisting the very Pope, were in alliance with the Barons. The
Barons were headed by Simon de Montfort, Earl of Leicester, married to
King Henry’s sister, and, though a foreigner himself, the most popular
man in England against the foreign favourites. When the King next met
his Parliament, the Barons, led by this Earl, came before him, armed
from head to foot, and cased in armour. When the Parliament again
assembled, in a month’s time, at Oxford, this Earl was at their head,
and the King was obliged to consent, on oath, to what was called a
Committee of Government: consisting of twenty-four members: twelve
chosen by the Barons, and twelve chosen by himself.

But, at a good time for him, his brother Richard came back. Richard’s
first act (the Barons would not admit him into England on other terms)
was to swear to be faithful to the Committee of Government—which he
immediately began to oppose with all his might. Then, the Barons began
to quarrel among themselves; especially the proud Earl of Gloucester
with the Earl of Leicester, who went abroad in disgust. Then, the
people began to be dissatisfied with the Barons, because they did not
do enough for them. The King’s chances seemed so good again at length,
that he took heart enough—or caught it from his brother—to tell the
Committee of Government that he abolished them—as to his oath, never
mind that, the Pope said!—and to seize all the money in the Mint, and
to shut himself up in the Tower of London. Here he was joined by his
eldest son, Prince Edward; and, from the Tower, he made public a letter
of the Pope’s to the world in general, informing all men that he had
been an excellent and just King for five-and-forty years.

As everybody knew he had been nothing of the sort, nobody cared much
for this document. It so chanced that the proud Earl of Gloucester
dying, was succeeded by his son; and that his son, instead of being the
enemy of the Earl of Leicester, was (for the time) his friend. It fell
out, therefore, that these two Earls joined their forces, took several
of the Royal Castles in the country, and advanced as hard as they could
on London. The London people, always opposed to the King, declared for
them with great joy. The King himself remained shut up, not at all
gloriously, in the Tower. Prince Edward made the best of his way to
Windsor Castle. His mother, the Queen, attempted to follow him by
water; but, the people seeing her barge rowing up the river, and hating
her with all their hearts, ran to London Bridge, got together a
quantity of stones and mud, and pelted the barge as it came through,
crying furiously, ‘Drown the Witch! Drown her!’ They were so near doing
it, that the Mayor took the old lady under his protection, and shut her
up in St. Paul’s until the danger was past.

It would require a great deal of writing on my part, and a great deal
of reading on yours, to follow the King through his disputes with the
Barons, and to follow the Barons through their disputes with one
another—so I will make short work of it for both of us, and only relate
the chief events that arose out of these quarrels. The good King of
France was asked to decide between them. He gave it as his opinion that
the King must maintain the Great Charter, and that the Barons must give
up the Committee of Government, and all the rest that had been done by
the Parliament at Oxford: which the Royalists, or King’s party,
scornfully called the Mad Parliament. The Barons declared that these
were not fair terms, and they would not accept them. Then they caused
the great bell of St. Paul’s to be tolled, for the purpose of rousing
up the London people, who armed themselves at the dismal sound and
formed quite an army in the streets. I am sorry to say, however, that
instead of falling upon the King’s party with whom their quarrel was,
they fell upon the miserable Jews, and killed at least five hundred of
them. They pretended that some of these Jews were on the King’s side,
and that they kept hidden in their houses, for the destruction of the
people, a certain terrible composition called Greek Fire, which could
not be put out with water, but only burnt the fiercer for it. What they
really did keep in their houses was money; and this their cruel enemies
wanted, and this their cruel enemies took, like robbers and murderers.

The Earl of Leicester put himself at the head of these Londoners and
other forces, and followed the King to Lewes in Sussex, where he lay
encamped with his army. Before giving the King’s forces battle here,
the Earl addressed his soldiers, and said that King Henry the Third had
broken so many oaths, that he had become the enemy of God, and
therefore they would wear white crosses on their breasts, as if they
were arrayed, not against a fellow-Christian, but against a Turk.
White-crossed accordingly, they rushed into the fight. They would have
lost the day—the King having on his side all the foreigners in England:
and, from Scotland, John Comyn, John Baliol, and Robert Bruce, with all
their men—but for the impatience of Prince Edward, who, in his hot
desire to have vengeance on the people of London, threw the whole of
his father’s army into confusion. He was taken Prisoner; so was the
King; so was the King’s brother the King of the Romans; and five
thousand Englishmen were left dead upon the bloody grass.

For this success, the Pope excommunicated the Earl of Leicester: which
neither the Earl nor the people cared at all about. The people loved
him and supported him, and he became the real King; having all the
power of the government in his own hands, though he was outwardly
respectful to King Henry the Third, whom he took with him wherever he
went, like a poor old limp court-card. He summoned a Parliament (in the
year one thousand two hundred and sixty-five) which was the first
Parliament in England that the people had any real share in electing;
and he grew more and more in favour with the people every day, and they
stood by him in whatever he did.

Many of the other Barons, and particularly the Earl of Gloucester, who
had become by this time as proud as his father, grew jealous of this
powerful and popular Earl, who was proud too, and began to conspire
against him. Since the battle of Lewes, Prince Edward had been kept as
a hostage, and, though he was otherwise treated like a Prince, had
never been allowed to go out without attendants appointed by the Earl
of Leicester, who watched him. The conspiring Lords found means to
propose to him, in secret, that they should assist him to escape, and
should make him their leader; to which he very heartily consented.

So, on a day that was agreed upon, he said to his attendants after
dinner (being then at Hereford), ‘I should like to ride on horseback,
this fine afternoon, a little way into the country.’ As they, too,
thought it would be very pleasant to have a canter in the sunshine,
they all rode out of the town together in a gay little troop. When they
came to a fine level piece of turf, the Prince fell to comparing their
horses one with another, and offering bets that one was faster than
another; and the attendants, suspecting no harm, rode galloping matches
until their horses were quite tired. The Prince rode no matches
himself, but looked on from his saddle, and staked his money. Thus they
passed the whole merry afternoon. Now, the sun was setting, and they
were all going slowly up a hill, the Prince’s horse very fresh and all
the other horses very weary, when a strange rider mounted on a grey
steed appeared at the top of the hill, and waved his hat. ‘What does
the fellow mean?’ said the attendants one to another. The Prince
answered on the instant by setting spurs to his horse, dashing away at
his utmost speed, joining the man, riding into the midst of a little
crowd of horsemen who were then seen waiting under some trees, and who
closed around him; and so he departed in a cloud of dust, leaving the
road empty of all but the baffled attendants, who sat looking at one
another, while their horses drooped their ears and panted.

The Prince joined the Earl of Gloucester at Ludlow. The Earl of
Leicester, with a part of the army and the stupid old King, was at
Hereford. One of the Earl of Leicester’s sons, Simon de Montfort, with
another part of the army, was in Sussex. To prevent these two parts
from uniting was the Prince’s first object. He attacked Simon de
Montfort by night, defeated him, seized his banners and treasure, and
forced him into Kenilworth Castle in Warwickshire, which belonged to
his family.

His father, the Earl of Leicester, in the meanwhile, not knowing what
had happened, marched out of Hereford, with his part of the army and
the King, to meet him. He came, on a bright morning in August, to
Evesham, which is watered by the pleasant river Avon. Looking rather
anxiously across the prospect towards Kenilworth, he saw his own
banners advancing; and his face brightened with joy. But, it clouded
darkly when he presently perceived that the banners were captured, and
in the enemy’s hands; and he said, ‘It is over. The Lord have mercy on
our souls, for our bodies are Prince Edward’s!’

He fought like a true Knight, nevertheless. When his horse was killed
under him, he fought on foot. It was a fierce battle, and the dead lay
in heaps everywhere. The old King, stuck up in a suit of armour on a
big war-horse, which didn’t mind him at all, and which carried him into
all sorts of places where he didn’t want to go, got into everybody’s
way, and very nearly got knocked on the head by one of his son’s men.
But he managed to pipe out, ‘I am Harry of Winchester!’ and the Prince,
who heard him, seized his bridle, and took him out of peril. The Earl
of Leicester still fought bravely, until his best son Henry was killed,
and the bodies of his best friends choked his path; and then he fell,
still fighting, sword in hand. They mangled his body, and sent it as a
present to a noble lady—but a very unpleasant lady, I should think—who
was the wife of his worst enemy. They could not mangle his memory in
the minds of the faithful people, though. Many years afterwards, they
loved him more than ever, and regarded him as a Saint, and always spoke
of him as ‘Sir Simon the Righteous.’

And even though he was dead, the cause for which he had fought still
lived, and was strong, and forced itself upon the King in the very hour
of victory. Henry found himself obliged to respect the Great Charter,
however much he hated it, and to make laws similar to the laws of the
Great Earl of Leicester, and to be moderate and forgiving towards the
people at last—even towards the people of London, who had so long
opposed him. There were more risings before all this was done, but they
were set at rest by these means, and Prince Edward did his best in all
things to restore peace. One Sir Adam de Gourdon was the last
dissatisfied knight in arms; but, the Prince vanquished him in single
combat, in a wood, and nobly gave him his life, and became his friend,
instead of slaying him. Sir Adam was not ungrateful. He ever afterwards
remained devoted to his generous conqueror.

When the troubles of the Kingdom were thus calmed, Prince Edward and
his cousin Henry took the Cross, and went away to the Holy Land, with
many English Lords and Knights. Four years afterwards the King of the
Romans died, and, next year (one thousand two hundred and seventy-two),
his brother the weak King of England died. He was sixty-eight years old
then, and had reigned fifty-six years. He was as much of a King in
death, as he had ever been in life. He was the mere pale shadow of a
King at all times.', 2549)

It was now the year of our Lord one thousand two hundred and
seventy-two; and Prince Edward, the heir to the throne, being away in
the Holy Land, knew nothing of his father’s death. The Barons, however,
proclaimed him King, immediately after the Royal funeral; and the
people very willingly consented, since most men knew too well by this
time what the horrors of a contest for the crown were. So King Edward
the First, called, in a not very complimentary manner, Longshanks,
because of the slenderness of his legs, was peacefully accepted by the
English Nation.

His legs had need to be strong, however long and thin they were; for
they had to support him through many difficulties on the fiery sands of
Asia, where his small force of soldiers fainted, died, deserted, and
seemed to melt away. But his prowess made light of it, and he said, ‘I
will go on, if I go on with no other follower than my groom!’

A Prince of this spirit gave the Turks a deal of trouble. He stormed
Nazareth, at which place, of all places on earth, I am sorry to relate,
he made a frightful slaughter of innocent people; and then he went to
Acre, where he got a truce of ten years from the Sultan. He had very
nearly lost his life in Acre, through the treachery of a Saracen Noble,
called the Emir of Jaffa, who, making the pretence that he had some
idea of turning Christian and wanted to know all about that religion,
sent a trusty messenger to Edward very often—with a dagger in his
sleeve. At last, one Friday in Whitsun week, when it was very hot, and
all the sandy prospect lay beneath the blazing sun, burnt up like a
great overdone biscuit, and Edward was lying on a couch, dressed for
coolness in only a loose robe, the messenger, with his
chocolate-coloured face and his bright dark eyes and white teeth, came
creeping in with a letter, and kneeled down like a tame tiger. But, the
moment Edward stretched out his hand to take the letter, the tiger made
a spring at his heart. He was quick, but Edward was quick too. He
seized the traitor by his chocolate throat, threw him to the ground,
and slew him with the very dagger he had drawn. The weapon had struck
Edward in the arm, and although the wound itself was slight, it
threatened to be mortal, for the blade of the dagger had been smeared
with poison. Thanks, however, to a better surgeon than was often to be
found in those times, and to some wholesome herbs, and above all, to
his faithful wife, Eleanor, who devotedly nursed him, and is said by
some to have sucked the poison from the wound with her own red lips
(which I am very willing to believe), Edward soon recovered and was
sound again.

As the King his father had sent entreaties to him to return home, he
now began the journey. He had got as far as Italy, when he met
messengers who brought him intelligence of the King’s death. Hearing
that all was quiet at home, he made no haste to return to his own
dominions, but paid a visit to the Pope, and went in state through
various Italian Towns, where he was welcomed with acclamations as a
mighty champion of the Cross from the Holy Land, and where he received
presents of purple mantles and prancing horses, and went along in great
triumph. The shouting people little knew that he was the last English
monarch who would ever embark in a crusade, or that within twenty years
every conquest which the Christians had made in the Holy Land at the
cost of so much blood, would be won back by the Turks. But all this
came to pass.

There was, and there is, an old town standing in a plain in France,
called Châlons. When the King was coming towards this place on his way
to England, a wily French Lord, called the Count of Châlons, sent him a
polite challenge to come with his knights and hold a fair tournament
with the Count and _his_ knights, and make a day of it with sword and
lance. It was represented to the King that the Count of Châlons was not
to be trusted, and that, instead of a holiday fight for mere show and
in good humour, he secretly meant a real battle, in which the English
should be defeated by superior force.

The King, however, nothing afraid, went to the appointed place on the
appointed day with a thousand followers. When the Count came with two
thousand and attacked the English in earnest, the English rushed at
them with such valour that the Count’s men and the Count’s horses soon
began to be tumbled down all over the field. The Count himself seized
the King round the neck, but the King tumbled _him_ out of his saddle
in return for the compliment, and, jumping from his own horse, and
standing over him, beat away at his iron armour like a blacksmith
hammering on his anvil. Even when the Count owned himself defeated and
offered his sword, the King would not do him the honour to take it, but
made him yield it up to a common soldier. There had been such fury
shown in this fight, that it was afterwards called the little Battle of
Châlons.

The English were very well disposed to be proud of their King after
these adventures; so, when he landed at Dover in the year one thousand
two hundred and seventy-four (being then thirty-six years old), and
went on to Westminster where he and his good Queen were crowned with
great magnificence, splendid rejoicings took place. For the
coronation-feast there were provided, among other eatables, four
hundred oxen, four hundred sheep, four hundred and fifty pigs, eighteen
wild boars, three hundred flitches of bacon, and twenty thousand fowls.
The fountains and conduits in the street flowed with red and white wine
instead of water; the rich citizens hung silks and cloths of the
brightest colours out of their windows to increase the beauty of the
show, and threw out gold and silver by whole handfuls to make scrambles
for the crowd. In short, there was such eating and drinking, such music
and capering, such a ringing of bells and tossing of caps, such a
shouting, and singing, and revelling, as the narrow overhanging streets
of old London City had not witnessed for many a long day. All the
people were merry except the poor Jews, who, trembling within their
houses, and scarcely daring to peep out, began to foresee that they
would have to find the money for this joviality sooner or later.

To dismiss this sad subject of the Jews for the present, I am sorry to
add that in this reign they were most unmercifully pillaged. They were
hanged in great numbers, on accusations of having clipped the King’s
coin—which all kinds of people had done. They were heavily taxed; they
were disgracefully badged; they were, on one day, thirteen years after
the coronation, taken up with their wives and children and thrown into
beastly prisons, until they purchased their release by paying to the
King twelve thousand pounds. Finally, every kind of property belonging
to them was seized by the King, except so little as would defray the
charge of their taking themselves away into foreign countries. Many
years elapsed before the hope of gain induced any of their race to
return to England, where they had been treated so heartlessly and had
suffered so much.

If King Edward the First had been as bad a king to Christians as he was
to Jews, he would have been bad indeed. But he was, in general, a wise
and great monarch, under whom the country much improved. He had no love
for the Great Charter—few Kings had, through many, many years—but he
had high qualities. The first bold object which he conceived when he
came home, was, to unite under one Sovereign England, Scotland, and
Wales; the two last of which countries had each a little king of its
own, about whom the people were always quarrelling and fighting, and
making a prodigious disturbance—a great deal more than he was worth. In
the course of King Edward’s reign he was engaged, besides, in a war
with France. To make these quarrels clearer, we will separate their
histories and take them thus. Wales, first. France, second. Scotland,
third.

Llewellyn was the Prince of Wales. He had been on the side of the
Barons in the reign of the stupid old King, but had afterwards sworn
allegiance to him. When King Edward came to the throne, Llewellyn was
required to swear allegiance to him also; which he refused to do. The
King, being crowned and in his own dominions, three times more required
Llewellyn to come and do homage; and three times more Llewellyn said he
would rather not. He was going to be married to Eleanor de Montfort, a
young lady of the family mentioned in the last reign; and it chanced
that this young lady, coming from France with her youngest brother,
Emeric, was taken by an English ship, and was ordered by the English
King to be detained. Upon this, the quarrel came to a head. The King
went, with his fleet, to the coast of Wales, where, so encompassing
Llewellyn, that he could only take refuge in the bleak mountain region
of Snowdon in which no provisions could reach him, he was soon starved
into an apology, and into a treaty of peace, and into paying the
expenses of the war. The King, however, forgave him some of the hardest
conditions of the treaty, and consented to his marriage. And he now
thought he had reduced Wales to obedience.

But the Welsh, although they were naturally a gentle, quiet, pleasant
people, who liked to receive strangers in their cottages among the
mountains, and to set before them with free hospitality whatever they
had to eat and drink, and to play to them on their harps, and sing
their native ballads to them, were a people of great spirit when their
blood was up. Englishmen, after this affair, began to be insolent in
Wales, and to assume the air of masters; and the Welsh pride could not
bear it. Moreover, they believed in that unlucky old Merlin, some of
whose unlucky old prophecies somebody always seemed doomed to remember
when there was a chance of its doing harm; and just at this time some
blind old gentleman with a harp and a long white beard, who was an
excellent person, but had become of an unknown age and tedious, burst
out with a declaration that Merlin had predicted that when English
money had become round, a Prince of Wales would be crowned in London.
Now, King Edward had recently forbidden the English penny to be cut
into halves and quarters for halfpence and farthings, and had actually
introduced a round coin; therefore, the Welsh people said this was the
time Merlin meant, and rose accordingly.

King Edward had bought over Prince David, Llewellyn’s brother, by
heaping favours upon him; but he was the first to revolt, being perhaps
troubled in his conscience. One stormy night, he surprised the Castle
of Hawarden, in possession of which an English nobleman had been left;
killed the whole garrison, and carried off the nobleman a prisoner to
Snowdon. Upon this, the Welsh people rose like one man. King Edward,
with his army, marching from Worcester to the Menai Strait, crossed
it—near to where the wonderful tubular iron bridge now, in days so
different, makes a passage for railway trains—by a bridge of boats that
enabled forty men to march abreast. He subdued the Island of Anglesea,
and sent his men forward to observe the enemy. The sudden appearance of
the Welsh created a panic among them, and they fell back to the bridge.
The tide had in the meantime risen and separated the boats; the Welsh
pursuing them, they were driven into the sea, and there they sunk, in
their heavy iron armour, by thousands. After this victory Llewellyn,
helped by the severe winter-weather of Wales, gained another battle;
but the King ordering a portion of his English army to advance through
South Wales, and catch him between two foes, and Llewellyn bravely
turning to meet this new enemy, he was surprised and killed—very
meanly, for he was unarmed and defenceless. His head was struck off and
sent to London, where it was fixed upon the Tower, encircled with a
wreath, some say of ivy, some say of willow, some say of silver, to
make it look like a ghastly coin in ridicule of the prediction.

David, however, still held out for six months, though eagerly sought
after by the King, and hunted by his own countrymen. One of them
finally betrayed him with his wife and children. He was sentenced to be
hanged, drawn, and quartered; and from that time this became the
established punishment of Traitors in England—a punishment wholly
without excuse, as being revolting, vile, and cruel, after its object
is dead; and which has no sense in it, as its only real degradation
(and that nothing can blot out) is to the country that permits on any
consideration such abominable barbarity.

Wales was now subdued. The Queen giving birth to a young prince in the
Castle of Carnarvon, the King showed him to the Welsh people as their
countryman, and called him Prince of Wales; a title that has ever since
been borne by the heir-apparent to the English throne—which that little
Prince soon became, by the death of his elder brother. The King did
better things for the Welsh than that, by improving their laws and
encouraging their trade. Disturbances still took place, chiefly
occasioned by the avarice and pride of the English Lords, on whom Welsh
lands and castles had been bestowed; but they were subdued, and the
country never rose again. There is a legend that to prevent the people
from being incited to rebellion by the songs of their bards and
harpers, Edward had them all put to death. Some of them may have fallen
among other men who held out against the King; but this general
slaughter is, I think, a fancy of the harpers themselves, who, I dare
say, made a song about it many years afterwards, and sang it by the
Welsh firesides until it came to be believed.

The foreign war of the reign of Edward the First arose in this way. The
crews of two vessels, one a Norman ship, and the other an English ship,
happened to go to the same place in their boats to fill their casks
with fresh water. Being rough angry fellows, they began to quarrel, and
then to fight—the English with their fists; the Normans with their
knives—and, in the fight, a Norman was killed. The Norman crew, instead
of revenging themselves upon those English sailors with whom they had
quarrelled (who were too strong for them, I suspect), took to their
ship again in a great rage, attacked the first English ship they met,
laid hold of an unoffending merchant who happened to be on board, and
brutally hanged him in the rigging of their own vessel with a dog at
his feet. This so enraged the English sailors that there was no
restraining them; and whenever, and wherever, English sailors met
Norman sailors, they fell upon each other tooth and nail. The Irish and
Dutch sailors took part with the English; the French and Genoese
sailors helped the Normans; and thus the greater part of the mariners
sailing over the sea became, in their way, as violent and raging as the
sea itself when it is disturbed.

King Edward’s fame had been so high abroad that he had been chosen to
decide a difference between France and another foreign power, and had
lived upon the Continent three years. At first, neither he nor the
French King Philip (the good Louis had been dead some time) interfered
in these quarrels; but when a fleet of eighty English ships engaged and
utterly defeated a Norman fleet of two hundred, in a pitched battle
fought round a ship at anchor, in which no quarter was given, the
matter became too serious to be passed over. King Edward, as Duke of
Guienne, was summoned to present himself before the King of France, at
Paris, and answer for the damage done by his sailor subjects. At first,
he sent the Bishop of London as his representative, and then his
brother Edmund, who was married to the French Queen’s mother. I am
afraid Edmund was an easy man, and allowed himself to be talked over by
his charming relations, the French court ladies; at all events, he was
induced to give up his brother’s dukedom for forty days—as a mere form,
the French King said, to satisfy his honour—and he was so very much
astonished, when the time was out, to find that the French King had no
idea of giving it up again, that I should not wonder if it hastened his
death: which soon took place.

King Edward was a King to win his foreign dukedom back again, if it
could be won by energy and valour. He raised a large army, renounced
his allegiance as Duke of Guienne, and crossed the sea to carry war
into France. Before any important battle was fought, however, a truce
was agreed upon for two years; and in the course of that time, the Pope
effected a reconciliation. King Edward, who was now a widower, having
lost his affectionate and good wife, Eleanor, married the French King’s
sister, Margaret; and the Prince of Wales was contracted to the French
King’s daughter Isabella.', 3006)
