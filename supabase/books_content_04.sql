“There isn’t a cat in it, for example?”

“No. What a strange idea!”

“Well, look at this!” He took up a small saucer of milk which stood on

the top of it.

“No; we don’t keep a cat. But there is a cheetah and a baboon.”

“Ah, yes, of course! Well, a cheetah is just a big cat, and yet a

saucer of milk does not go very far in satisfying its wants, I daresay.

There is one point which I should wish to determine.” He squatted down

in front of the wooden chair and examined the seat of it with the

greatest attention.

“Thank you. That is quite settled,” said he, rising and putting his

lens in his pocket. “Hullo! Here is something interesting!”

The object which had caught his eye was a small dog lash hung on one

corner of the bed. The lash, however, was curled upon itself and tied

so as to make a loop of whipcord.

“What do you make of that, Watson?”

“It’s a common enough lash. But I don’t know why it should be tied.”

“That is not quite so common, is it? Ah, me! it’s a wicked world, and

when a clever man turns his brains to crime it is the worst of all. I

think that I have seen enough now, Miss Stoner, and with your

permission we shall walk out upon the lawn.”

I had never seen my friend’s face so grim or his brow so dark as it was

when we turned from the scene of this investigation. We had walked

several times up and down the lawn, neither Miss Stoner nor myself

liking to break in upon his thoughts before he roused himself from his

reverie.

“It is very essential, Miss Stoner,” said he, “that you should

absolutely follow my advice in every respect.”

“I shall most certainly do so.”

“The matter is too serious for any hesitation. Your life may depend

upon your compliance.”

“I assure you that I am in your hands.”

“In the first place, both my friend and I must spend the night in your

room.”

Both Miss Stoner and I gazed at him in astonishment.

“Yes, it must be so. Let me explain. I believe that that is the village

inn over there?”

“Yes, that is the Crown.”

“Very good. Your windows would be visible from there?”

“Certainly.”

“You must confine yourself to your room, on pretence of a headache,

when your stepfather comes back. Then when you hear him retire for the

night, you must open the shutters of your window, undo the hasp, put

your lamp there as a signal to us, and then withdraw quietly with

everything which you are likely to want into the room which you used to

occupy. I have no doubt that, in spite of the repairs, you could manage

there for one night.”

“Oh, yes, easily.”

“The rest you will leave in our hands.”

“But what will you do?”

“We shall spend the night in your room, and we shall investigate the

cause of this noise which has disturbed you.”

“I believe, Mr. Holmes, that you have already made up your mind,” said

Miss Stoner, laying her hand upon my companion’s sleeve.

“Perhaps I have.”

“Then, for pity’s sake, tell me what was the cause of my sister’s

death.”

“I should prefer to have clearer proofs before I speak.”

“You can at least tell me whether my own thought is correct, and if she

died from some sudden fright.”

“No, I do not think so. I think that there was probably some more

tangible cause. And now, Miss Stoner, we must leave you for if Dr.

Roylott returned and saw us our journey would be in vain. Good-bye, and

be brave, for if you will do what I have told you, you may rest assured

that we shall soon drive away the dangers that threaten you.”

Sherlock Holmes and I had no difficulty in engaging a bedroom and

sitting-room at the Crown Inn. They were on the upper floor, and from

our window we could command a view of the avenue gate, and of the

inhabited wing of Stoke Moran Manor House. At dusk we saw Dr. Grimesby

Roylott drive past, his huge form looming up beside the little figure

of the lad who drove him. The boy had some slight difficulty in undoing

the heavy iron gates, and we heard the hoarse roar of the Doctor’s

voice and saw the fury with which he shook his clinched fists at him.

The trap drove on, and a few minutes later we saw a sudden light spring

up among the trees as the lamp was lit in one of the sitting-rooms.

“Do you know, Watson,” said Holmes as we sat together in the gathering

darkness, “I have really some scruples as to taking you to-night. There

is a distinct element of danger.”

“Can I be of assistance?”

“Your presence might be invaluable.”

“Then I shall certainly come.”

“It is very kind of you.”

“You speak of danger. You have evidently seen more in these rooms than

was visible to me.”

“No, but I fancy that I may have deduced a little more. I imagine that

you saw all that I did.”

“I saw nothing remarkable save the bell-rope, and what purpose that

could answer I confess is more than I can imagine.”

“You saw the ventilator, too?”

“Yes, but I do not think that it is such a very unusual thing to have a

small opening between two rooms. It was so small that a rat could

hardly pass through.”

“I knew that we should find a ventilator before ever we came to Stoke

Moran.”

“My dear Holmes!”

“Oh, yes, I did. You remember in her statement she said that her sister

could smell Dr. Roylott’s cigar. Now, of course that suggested at once

that there must be a communication between the two rooms. It could only

be a small one, or it would have been remarked upon at the coroner’s

inquiry. I deduced a ventilator.”

“But what harm can there be in that?”

“Well, there is at least a curious coincidence of dates. A ventilator

is made, a cord is hung, and a lady who sleeps in the bed dies. Does

not that strike you?”

“I cannot as yet see any connection.”

“Did you observe anything very peculiar about that bed?”

“No.”

“It was clamped to the floor. Did you ever see a bed fastened like that

before?”

“I cannot say that I have.”

“The lady could not move her bed. It must always be in the same

relative position to the ventilator and to the rope—or so we may call

it, since it was clearly never meant for a bell-pull.”

“Holmes,” I cried, “I seem to see dimly what you are hinting at. We are

only just in time to prevent some subtle and horrible crime.”

“Subtle enough and horrible enough. When a doctor does go wrong he is

the first of criminals. He has nerve and he has knowledge. Palmer and

Pritchard were among the heads of their profession. This man strikes

even deeper, but I think, Watson, that we shall be able to strike

deeper still. But we shall have horrors enough before the night is

over; for goodness’ sake let us have a quiet pipe and turn our minds

for a few hours to something more cheerful.”

About nine o’clock the light among the trees was extinguished, and all

was dark in the direction of the Manor House. Two hours passed slowly

away, and then, suddenly, just at the stroke of eleven, a single bright

light shone out right in front of us.

“That is our signal,” said Holmes, springing to his feet; “it comes

from the middle window.”

As we passed out he exchanged a few words with the landlord, explaining

that we were going on a late visit to an acquaintance, and that it was

possible that we might spend the night there. A moment later we were

out on the dark road, a chill wind blowing in our faces, and one yellow

light twinkling in front of us through the gloom to guide us on our

sombre errand.

There was little difficulty in entering the grounds, for unrepaired

breaches gaped in the old park wall. Making our way among the trees, we

reached the lawn, crossed it, and were about to enter through the

window when out from a clump of laurel bushes there darted what seemed

to be a hideous and distorted child, who threw itself upon the grass

with writhing limbs and then ran swiftly across the lawn into the

darkness.

“My God!” I whispered; “did you see it?”

Holmes was for the moment as startled as I. His hand closed like a vice

upon my wrist in his agitation. Then he broke into a low laugh and put

his lips to my ear.

“It is a nice household,” he murmured. “That is the baboon.”

I had forgotten the strange pets which the Doctor affected. There was a

cheetah, too; perhaps we might find it upon our shoulders at any

moment. I confess that I felt easier in my mind when, after following

Holmes’ example and slipping off my shoes, I found myself inside the

bedroom. My companion noiselessly closed the shutters, moved the lamp

onto the table, and cast his eyes round the room. All was as we had

seen it in the daytime. Then creeping up to me and making a trumpet of

his hand, he whispered into my ear again so gently that it was all that

I could do to distinguish the words:

“The least sound would be fatal to our plans.”

I nodded to show that I had heard.

“We must sit without light. He would see it through the ventilator.”

I nodded again.

“Do not go asleep; your very life may depend upon it. Have your pistol

ready in case we should need it. I will sit on the side of the bed, and

you in that chair.”

I took out my revolver and laid it on the corner of the table.

Holmes had brought up a long thin cane, and this he placed upon the bed

beside him. By it he laid the box of matches and the stump of a candle.

Then he turned down the lamp, and we were left in darkness.

How shall I ever forget that dreadful vigil? I could not hear a sound,

not even the drawing of a breath, and yet I knew that my companion sat

open-eyed, within a few feet of me, in the same state of nervous

tension in which I was myself. The shutters cut off the least ray of

light, and we waited in absolute darkness.

From outside came the occasional cry of a night-bird, and once at our

very window a long drawn catlike whine, which told us that the cheetah

was indeed at liberty. Far away we could hear the deep tones of the

parish clock, which boomed out every quarter of an hour. How long they

seemed, those quarters! Twelve struck, and one and two and three, and

still we sat waiting silently for whatever might befall.

Suddenly there was the momentary gleam of a light up in the direction

of the ventilator, which vanished immediately, but was succeeded by a

strong smell of burning oil and heated metal. Someone in the next room

had lit a dark-lantern. I heard a gentle sound of movement, and then

all was silent once more, though the smell grew stronger. For half an

hour I sat with straining ears. Then suddenly another sound became

audible—a very gentle, soothing sound, like that of a small jet of

steam escaping continually from a kettle. The instant that we heard it,

Holmes sprang from the bed, struck a match, and lashed furiously with

his cane at the bell-pull.

“You see it, Watson?” he yelled. “You see it?”

But I saw nothing. At the moment when Holmes struck the light I heard a

low, clear whistle, but the sudden glare flashing into my weary eyes

made it impossible for me to tell what it was at which my friend lashed

so savagely. I could, however, see that his face was deadly pale and

filled with horror and loathing. He had ceased to strike and was gazing

up at the ventilator when suddenly there broke from the silence of the

night the most horrible cry to which I have ever listened. It swelled

up louder and louder, a hoarse yell of pain and fear and anger all

mingled in the one dreadful shriek. They say that away down in the

village, and even in the distant parsonage, that cry raised the

sleepers from their beds. It struck cold to our hearts, and I stood

gazing at Holmes, and he at me, until the last echoes of it had died

away into the silence from which it rose.

“What can it mean?” I gasped.

“It means that it is all over,” Holmes answered. “And perhaps, after

all, it is for the best. Take your pistol, and we will enter Dr.

Roylott’s room.”

With a grave face he lit the lamp and led the way down the corridor.

Twice he struck at the chamber door without any reply from within. Then

he turned the handle and entered, I at his heels, with the cocked

pistol in my hand.

It was a singular sight which met our eyes. On the table stood a

dark-lantern with the shutter half open, throwing a brilliant beam of

light upon the iron safe, the door of which was ajar. Beside this

table, on the wooden chair, sat Dr. Grimesby Roylott clad in a long

grey dressing-gown, his bare ankles protruding beneath, and his feet

thrust into red heelless Turkish slippers. Across his lap lay the short

stock with the long lash which we had noticed during the day. His chin

was cocked upward and his eyes were fixed in a dreadful, rigid stare at

the corner of the ceiling. Round his brow he had a peculiar yellow

band, with brownish speckles, which seemed to be bound tightly round

his head. As we entered he made neither sound nor motion.

“The band! the speckled band!” whispered Holmes.

I took a step forward. In an instant his strange headgear began to

move, and there reared itself from among his hair the squat

diamond-shaped head and puffed neck of a loathsome serpent.

“It is a swamp adder!” cried Holmes; “the deadliest snake in India. He

has died within ten seconds of being bitten. Violence does, in truth,

recoil upon the violent, and the schemer falls into the pit which he

digs for another. Let us thrust this creature back into its den, and we

can then remove Miss Stoner to some place of shelter and let the county

police know what has happened.”

As he spoke he drew the dog-whip swiftly from the dead man’s lap, and

throwing the noose round the reptile’s neck he drew it from its horrid

perch and, carrying it at arm’s length, threw it into the iron safe,

which he closed upon it.

Such are the true facts of the death of Dr. Grimesby Roylott, of Stoke

Moran. It is not necessary that I should prolong a narrative which has

already run to too great a length by telling how we broke the sad news

to the terrified girl, how we conveyed her by the morning train to the

care of her good aunt at Harrow, of how the slow process of official

inquiry came to the conclusion that the doctor met his fate while

indiscreetly playing with a dangerous pet. The little which I had yet

to learn of the case was told me by Sherlock Holmes as we travelled

back next day.

“I had,” said he, “come to an entirely erroneous conclusion which

shows, my dear Watson, how dangerous it always is to reason from

insufficient data. The presence of the gipsies, and the use of the word

‘band,’ which was used by the poor girl, no doubt, to explain the

appearance which she had caught a hurried glimpse of by the light of

her match, were sufficient to put me upon an entirely wrong scent. I

can only claim the merit that I instantly reconsidered my position

when, however, it became clear to me that whatever danger threatened an

occupant of the room could not come either from the window or the door.

My attention was speedily drawn, as I have already remarked to you, to

this ventilator, and to the bell-rope which hung down to the bed. The

discovery that this was a dummy, and that the bed was clamped to the

floor, instantly gave rise to the suspicion that the rope was there as

a bridge for something passing through the hole and coming to the bed.

The idea of a snake instantly occurred to me, and when I coupled it

with my knowledge that the doctor was furnished with a supply of

creatures from India, I felt that I was probably on the right track.

The idea of using a form of poison which could not possibly be

discovered by any chemical test was just such a one as would occur to a

clever and ruthless man who had had an Eastern training. The rapidity

with which such a poison would take effect would also, from his point

of view, be an advantage. It would be a sharp-eyed coroner, indeed, who

could distinguish the two little dark punctures which would show where

the poison fangs had done their work. Then I thought of the whistle. Of

course he must recall the snake before the morning light revealed it to

the victim. He had trained it, probably by the use of the milk which we

saw, to return to him when summoned. He would put it through this

ventilator at the hour that he thought best, with the certainty that it

would crawl down the rope and land on the bed. It might or might not

bite the occupant, perhaps she might escape every night for a week, but

sooner or later she must fall a victim.

“I had come to these conclusions before ever I had entered his room. An

inspection of his chair showed me that he had been in the habit of

standing on it, which of course would be necessary in order that he

should reach the ventilator. The sight of the safe, the saucer of milk,

and the loop of whipcord were enough to finally dispel any doubts which

may have remained. The metallic clang heard by Miss Stoner was

obviously caused by her stepfather hastily closing the door of his safe

upon its terrible occupant. Having once made up my mind, you know the

steps which I took in order to put the matter to the proof. I heard the

creature hiss as I have no doubt that you did also, and I instantly lit

the light and attacked it.”

“With the result of driving it through the ventilator.”

“And also with the result of causing it to turn upon its master at the

other side. Some of the blows of my cane came home and roused its

snakish temper, so that it flew upon the first person it saw. In this

way I am no doubt indirectly responsible for Dr. Grimesby Roylott’s

death, and I cannot say that it is likely to weigh very heavily upon my

conscience.”', 3275)

Sherlock Holmes, for solution during the years of our intimacy, there

were only two which I was the means of introducing to his notice—that

of Mr. Hatherley’s thumb, and that of Colonel Warburton’s madness. Of

these the latter may have afforded a finer field for an acute and

original observer, but the other was so strange in its inception and so

dramatic in its details that it may be the more worthy of being placed

upon record, even if it gave my friend fewer openings for those

deductive methods of reasoning by which he achieved such remarkable

results. The story has, I believe, been told more than once in the

newspapers, but, like all such narratives, its effect is much less

striking when set forth _en bloc_ in a single half-column of print than

when the facts slowly evolve before your own eyes, and the mystery

clears gradually away as each new discovery furnishes a step which

leads on to the complete truth. At the time the circumstances made a

deep impression upon me, and the lapse of two years has hardly served

to weaken the effect.

It was in the summer of ’89, not long after my marriage, that the

events occurred which I am now about to summarise. I had returned to

civil practice and had finally abandoned Holmes in his Baker Street

rooms, although I continually visited him and occasionally even

persuaded him to forgo his Bohemian habits so far as to come and visit

us. My practice had steadily increased, and as I happened to live at no

very great distance from Paddington Station, I got a few patients from

among the officials. One of these, whom I had cured of a painful and

lingering disease, was never weary of advertising my virtues and of

endeavouring to send me on every sufferer over whom he might have any

influence.

One morning, at a little before seven o’clock, I was awakened by the

maid tapping at the door to announce that two men had come from

Paddington and were waiting in the consulting-room. I dressed

hurriedly, for I knew by experience that railway cases were seldom

trivial, and hastened downstairs. As I descended, my old ally, the

guard, came out of the room and closed the door tightly behind him.

“I’ve got him here,” he whispered, jerking his thumb over his shoulder;

“he’s all right.”

“What is it, then?” I asked, for his manner suggested that it was some

strange creature which he had caged up in my room.

“It’s a new patient,” he whispered. “I thought I’d bring him round

myself; then he couldn’t slip away. There he is, all safe and sound. I

must go now, Doctor; I have my dooties, just the same as you.” And off

he went, this trusty tout, without even giving me time to thank him.

I entered my consulting-room and found a gentleman seated by the table.

He was quietly dressed in a suit of heather tweed with a soft cloth cap

which he had laid down upon my books. Round one of his hands he had a

handkerchief wrapped, which was mottled all over with bloodstains. He

was young, not more than five-and-twenty, I should say, with a strong,

masculine face; but he was exceedingly pale and gave me the impression

of a man who was suffering from some strong agitation, which it took

all his strength of mind to control.

“I am sorry to knock you up so early, Doctor,” said he, “but I have had

a very serious accident during the night. I came in by train this

morning, and on inquiring at Paddington as to where I might find a

doctor, a worthy fellow very kindly escorted me here. I gave the maid a

card, but I see that she has left it upon the side-table.”

I took it up and glanced at it. “Mr. Victor Hatherley, hydraulic

engineer, 16A, Victoria Street (3rd floor).” That was the name, style,

and abode of my morning visitor. “I regret that I have kept you

waiting,” said I, sitting down in my library-chair. “You are fresh from

a night journey, I understand, which is in itself a monotonous

occupation.”

“Oh, my night could not be called monotonous,” said he, and laughed. He

laughed very heartily, with a high, ringing note, leaning back in his

chair and shaking his sides. All my medical instincts rose up against

that laugh.

“Stop it!” I cried; “pull yourself together!” and I poured out some

water from a caraffe.

It was useless, however. He was off in one of those hysterical

outbursts which come upon a strong nature when some great crisis is

over and gone. Presently he came to himself once more, very weary and

pale-looking.

“I have been making a fool of myself,” he gasped.

“Not at all. Drink this.” I dashed some brandy into the water, and the

colour began to come back to his bloodless cheeks.

“That’s better!” said he. “And now, Doctor, perhaps you would kindly

attend to my thumb, or rather to the place where my thumb used to be.”

He unwound the handkerchief and held out his hand. It gave even my

hardened nerves a shudder to look at it. There were four protruding

fingers and a horrid red, spongy surface where the thumb should have

been. It had been hacked or torn right out from the roots.

“Good heavens!” I cried, “this is a terrible injury. It must have bled

considerably.”

“Yes, it did. I fainted when it was done, and I think that I must have

been senseless for a long time. When I came to I found that it was

still bleeding, so I tied one end of my handkerchief very tightly round

the wrist and braced it up with a twig.”

“Excellent! You should have been a surgeon.”

“It is a question of hydraulics, you see, and came within my own

province.”

“This has been done,” said I, examining the wound, “by a very heavy and

sharp instrument.”

“A thing like a cleaver,” said he.

“An accident, I presume?”

“By no means.”

“What! a murderous attack?”

“Very murderous indeed.”

“You horrify me.”

I sponged the wound, cleaned it, dressed it, and finally covered it

over with cotton wadding and carbolised bandages. He lay back without

wincing, though he bit his lip from time to time.

“How is that?” I asked when I had finished.

“Capital! Between your brandy and your bandage, I feel a new man. I was

very weak, but I have had a good deal to go through.”

“Perhaps you had better not speak of the matter. It is evidently trying

to your nerves.”

“Oh, no, not now. I shall have to tell my tale to the police; but,

between ourselves, if it were not for the convincing evidence of this

wound of mine, I should be surprised if they believed my statement, for

it is a very extraordinary one, and I have not much in the way of proof

with which to back it up; and, even if they believe me, the clues which

I can give them are so vague that it is a question whether justice will

be done.”

“Ha!” cried I, “if it is anything in the nature of a problem which you

desire to see solved, I should strongly recommend you to come to my

friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, before you go to the official police.”

“Oh, I have heard of that fellow,” answered my visitor, “and I should

be very glad if he would take the matter up, though of course I must

use the official police as well. Would you give me an introduction to

him?”

“I’ll do better. I’ll take you round to him myself.”

“I should be immensely obliged to you.”

“We’ll call a cab and go together. We shall just be in time to have a

little breakfast with him. Do you feel equal to it?”

“Yes; I shall not feel easy until I have told my story.”

“Then my servant will call a cab, and I shall be with you in an

instant.” I rushed upstairs, explained the matter shortly to my wife,

and in five minutes was inside a hansom, driving with my new

acquaintance to Baker Street.

Sherlock Holmes was, as I expected, lounging about his sitting-room in

his dressing-gown, reading the agony column of _The Times_ and smoking

his before-breakfast pipe, which was composed of all the plugs and

dottles left from his smokes of the day before, all carefully dried and

collected on the corner of the mantelpiece. He received us in his

quietly genial fashion, ordered fresh rashers and eggs, and joined us

in a hearty meal. When it was concluded he settled our new acquaintance

upon the sofa, placed a pillow beneath his head, and laid a glass of

brandy and water within his reach.

“It is easy to see that your experience has been no common one, Mr.

Hatherley,” said he. “Pray, lie down there and make yourself absolutely

at home. Tell us what you can, but stop when you are tired and keep up

your strength with a little stimulant.”

“Thank you,” said my patient, “but I have felt another man since the

doctor bandaged me, and I think that your breakfast has completed the

cure. I shall take up as little of your valuable time as possible, so I

shall start at once upon my peculiar experiences.”

Holmes sat in his big armchair with the weary, heavy-lidded expression

which veiled his keen and eager nature, while I sat opposite to him,

and we listened in silence to the strange story which our visitor

detailed to us.

“You must know,” said he, “that I am an orphan and a bachelor, residing

alone in lodgings in London. By profession I am a hydraulic engineer,

and I have had considerable experience of my work during the seven

years that I was apprenticed to Venner & Matheson, the well-known firm,

of Greenwich. Two years ago, having served my time, and having also

come into a fair sum of money through my poor father’s death, I

determined to start in business for myself and took professional

chambers in Victoria Street.

“I suppose that everyone finds his first independent start in business

a dreary experience. To me it has been exceptionally so. During two

years I have had three consultations and one small job, and that is

absolutely all that my profession has brought me. My gross takings

amount to £ 27 10_s_. Every day, from nine in the morning until four in

the afternoon, I waited in my little den, until at last my heart began

to sink, and I came to believe that I should never have any practice at

all.

“Yesterday, however, just as I was thinking of leaving the office, my

clerk entered to say there was a gentleman waiting who wished to see me

upon business. He brought up a card, too, with the name of ‘Colonel

Lysander Stark’ engraved upon it. Close at his heels came the colonel

himself, a man rather over the middle size, but of an exceeding

thinness. I do not think that I have ever seen so thin a man. His whole

face sharpened away into nose and chin, and the skin of his cheeks was

drawn quite tense over his outstanding bones. Yet this emaciation

seemed to be his natural habit, and due to no disease, for his eye was

bright, his step brisk, and his bearing assured. He was plainly but

neatly dressed, and his age, I should judge, would be nearer forty than

thirty.

“‘Mr. Hatherley?’ said he, with something of a German accent. ‘You have

been recommended to me, Mr. Hatherley, as being a man who is not only

proficient in his profession but is also discreet and capable of

preserving a secret.’

“I bowed, feeling as flattered as any young man would at such an

address. ‘May I ask who it was who gave me so good a character?’

“‘Well, perhaps it is better that I should not tell you that just at

this moment. I have it from the same source that you are both an orphan

and a bachelor and are residing alone in London.’

“‘That is quite correct,’ I answered; ‘but you will excuse me if I say

that I cannot see how all this bears upon my professional

qualifications. I understand that it was on a professional matter that

you wished to speak to me?’

“‘Undoubtedly so. But you will find that all I say is really to the

point. I have a professional commission for you, but absolute secrecy

is quite essential—absolute secrecy, you understand, and of course we

may expect that more from a man who is alone than from one who lives in

the bosom of his family.’

“‘If I promise to keep a secret,’ said I, ‘you may absolutely depend

upon my doing so.’

“He looked very hard at me as I spoke, and it seemed to me that I had

never seen so suspicious and questioning an eye.

“‘Do you promise, then?’ said he at last.

“‘Yes, I promise.’

“‘Absolute and complete silence before, during, and after? No reference

to the matter at all, either in word or writing?’

“‘I have already given you my word.’

“‘Very good.’ He suddenly sprang up, and darting like lightning across

the room he flung open the door. The passage outside was empty.

“‘That’s all right,’ said he, coming back. ‘I know that clerks are

sometimes curious as to their master’s affairs. Now we can talk in

safety.’ He drew up his chair very close to mine and began to stare at

me again with the same questioning and thoughtful look.

“A feeling of repulsion, and of something akin to fear had begun to

rise within me at the strange antics of this fleshless man. Even my

dread of losing a client could not restrain me from showing my

impatience.

“‘I beg that you will state your business, sir,’ said I; ‘my time is of

value.’ Heaven forgive me for that last sentence, but the words came to

my lips.

“‘How would fifty guineas for a night’s work suit you?’ he asked.

“‘Most admirably.’

“‘I say a night’s work, but an hour’s would be nearer the mark. I

simply want your opinion about a hydraulic stamping machine which has

got out of gear. If you show us what is wrong we shall soon set it

right ourselves. What do you think of such a commission as that?’

“‘The work appears to be light and the pay munificent.’

“‘Precisely so. We shall want you to come to-night by the last train.’

“‘Where to?’

“‘To Eyford, in Berkshire. It is a little place near the borders of

Oxfordshire, and within seven miles of Reading. There is a train from

Paddington which would bring you there at about 11:15.’

“‘Very good.’

“‘I shall come down in a carriage to meet you.’

“‘There is a drive, then?’

“‘Yes, our little place is quite out in the country. It is a good seven

miles from Eyford Station.’

“‘Then we can hardly get there before midnight. I suppose there would

be no chance of a train back. I should be compelled to stop the night.’

“‘Yes, we could easily give you a shake-down.’

“‘That is very awkward. Could I not come at some more convenient hour?’

“‘We have judged it best that you should come late. It is to recompense

you for any inconvenience that we are paying to you, a young and

unknown man, a fee which would buy an opinion from the very heads of

your profession. Still, of course, if you would like to draw out of the

business, there is plenty of time to do so.’

“I thought of the fifty guineas, and of how very useful they would be

to me. ‘Not at all,’ said I, ‘I shall be very happy to accommodate

myself to your wishes. I should like, however, to understand a little

more clearly what it is that you wish me to do.’

“‘Quite so. It is very natural that the pledge of secrecy which we have

exacted from you should have aroused your curiosity. I have no wish to

commit you to anything without your having it all laid before you. I

suppose that we are absolutely safe from eavesdroppers?’

“‘Entirely.’

“‘Then the matter stands thus. You are probably aware that', 2760)

or two places in England?’

“‘I have heard so.’

“‘Some little time ago I bought a small place—a very small place—within

ten miles of Reading. I was fortunate enough to discover that there was

a deposit of fuller’s-earth in one of my fields. On examining it,

however, I found that this deposit was a comparatively small one, and

that it formed a link between two very much larger ones upon the right

and left—both of them, however, in the grounds of my neighbours. These

good people were absolutely ignorant that their land contained that

which was quite as valuable as a gold-mine. Naturally, it was to my

interest to buy their land before they discovered its true value, but

unfortunately I had no capital by which I could do this. I took a few

of my friends into the secret, however, and they suggested that we

should quietly and secretly work our own little deposit and that in

this way we should earn the money which would enable us to buy the

neighbouring fields. This we have now been doing for some time, and in

order to help us in our operations we erected a hydraulic press. This

press, as I have already explained, has got out of order, and we wish

your advice upon the subject. We guard our secret very jealously,

however, and if it once became known that we had hydraulic engineers

coming to our little house, it would soon rouse inquiry, and then, if

the facts came out, it would be good-bye to any chance of getting these

fields and carrying out our plans. That is why I have made you promise

me that you will not tell a human being that you are going to Eyford

to-night. I hope that I make it all plain?’

“‘I quite follow you,’ said I. ‘The only point which I could not quite

understand was what use you could make of a hydraulic press in

excavating fuller’s-earth, which, as I understand, is dug out like

gravel from a pit.’

“‘Ah!’ said he carelessly, ‘we have our own process. We compress the

earth into bricks, so as to remove them without revealing what they

are. But that is a mere detail. I have taken you fully into my

confidence now, Mr. Hatherley, and I have shown you how I trust you.’

He rose as he spoke. ‘I shall expect you, then, at Eyford at 11:15.’

“‘I shall certainly be there.’

“‘And not a word to a soul.’ He looked at me with a last long,

questioning gaze, and then, pressing my hand in a cold, dank grasp, he

hurried from the room.

“Well, when I came to think it all over in cool blood I was very much

astonished, as you may both think, at this sudden commission which had

been intrusted to me. On the one hand, of course, I was glad, for the

fee was at least tenfold what I should have asked had I set a price

upon my own services, and it was possible that this order might lead to

other ones. On the other hand, the face and manner of my patron had

made an unpleasant impression upon me, and I could not think that his

explanation of the fuller’s-earth was sufficient to explain the

necessity for my coming at midnight, and his extreme anxiety lest I

should tell anyone of my errand. However, I threw all fears to the

winds, ate a hearty supper, drove to Paddington, and started off,

having obeyed to the letter the injunction as to holding my tongue.

“At Reading I had to change not only my carriage but my station.

However, I was in time for the last train to Eyford, and I reached the

little dim-lit station after eleven o’clock. I was the only passenger

who got out there, and there was no one upon the platform save a single

sleepy porter with a lantern. As I passed out through the wicket gate,

however, I found my acquaintance of the morning waiting in the shadow

upon the other side. Without a word he grasped my arm and hurried me

into a carriage, the door of which was standing open. He drew up the

windows on either side, tapped on the wood-work, and away we went as

fast as the horse could go.”

“One horse?” interjected Holmes.

“Yes, only one.”

“Did you observe the colour?”

“Yes, I saw it by the side-lights when I was stepping into the

carriage. It was a chestnut.”

“Tired-looking or fresh?”

“Oh, fresh and glossy.”

“Thank you. I am sorry to have interrupted you. Pray continue your most

interesting statement.”

“Away we went then, and we drove for at least an hour. Colonel Lysander

Stark had said that it was only seven miles, but I should think, from

the rate that we seemed to go, and from the time that we took, that it

must have been nearer twelve. He sat at my side in silence all the

time, and I was aware, more than once when I glanced in his direction,

that he was looking at me with great intensity. The country roads seem

to be not very good in that part of the world, for we lurched and

jolted terribly. I tried to look out of the windows to see something of

where we were, but they were made of frosted glass, and I could make

out nothing save the occasional bright blur of a passing light. Now and

then I hazarded some remark to break the monotony of the journey, but

the colonel answered only in monosyllables, and the conversation soon

flagged. At last, however, the bumping of the road was exchanged for

the crisp smoothness of a gravel-drive, and the carriage came to a

stand. Colonel Lysander Stark sprang out, and, as I followed after him,

pulled me swiftly into a porch which gaped in front of us. We stepped,

as it were, right out of the carriage and into the hall, so that I

failed to catch the most fleeting glance of the front of the house. The

instant that I had crossed the threshold the door slammed heavily

behind us, and I heard faintly the rattle of the wheels as the carriage

drove away.

“It was pitch dark inside the house, and the colonel fumbled about

looking for matches and muttering under his breath. Suddenly a door

opened at the other end of the passage, and a long, golden bar of light

shot out in our direction. It grew broader, and a woman appeared with a

lamp in her hand, which she held above her head, pushing her face

forward and peering at us. I could see that she was pretty, and from

the gloss with which the light shone upon her dark dress I knew that it

was a rich material. She spoke a few words in a foreign tongue in a

tone as though asking a question, and when my companion answered in a

gruff monosyllable she gave such a start that the lamp nearly fell from

her hand. Colonel Stark went up to her, whispered something in her ear,

and then, pushing her back into the room from whence she had come, he

walked towards me again with the lamp in his hand.

“‘Perhaps you will have the kindness to wait in this room for a few

minutes,’ said he, throwing open another door. It was a quiet, little,

plainly furnished room, with a round table in the centre, on which

several German books were scattered. Colonel Stark laid down the lamp

on the top of a harmonium beside the door. ‘I shall not keep you

waiting an instant,’ said he, and vanished into the darkness.

“I glanced at the books upon the table, and in spite of my ignorance of

German I could see that two of them were treatises on science, the

others being volumes of poetry. Then I walked across to the window,

hoping that I might catch some glimpse of the country-side, but an oak

shutter, heavily barred, was folded across it. It was a wonderfully

silent house. There was an old clock ticking loudly somewhere in the

passage, but otherwise everything was deadly still. A vague feeling of

uneasiness began to steal over me. Who were these German people, and

what were they doing living in this strange, out-of-the-way place? And

where was the place? I was ten miles or so from Eyford, that was all I

knew, but whether north, south, east, or west I had no idea. For that

matter, Reading, and possibly other large towns, were within that

radius, so the place might not be so secluded, after all. Yet it was

quite certain, from the absolute stillness, that we were in the

country. I paced up and down the room, humming a tune under my breath

to keep up my spirits and feeling that I was thoroughly earning my

fifty-guinea fee.

“Suddenly, without any preliminary sound in the midst of the utter

stillness, the door of my room swung slowly open. The woman was

standing in the aperture, the darkness of the hall behind her, the

yellow light from my lamp beating upon her eager and beautiful face. I

could see at a glance that she was sick with fear, and the sight sent a

chill to my own heart. She held up one shaking finger to warn me to be

silent, and she shot a few whispered words of broken English at me, her

eyes glancing back, like those of a frightened horse, into the gloom

behind her.

“‘I would go,’ said she, trying hard, as it seemed to me, to speak

calmly; ‘I would go. I should not stay here. There is no good for you

to do.’

“‘But, madam,’ said I, ‘I have not yet done what I came for. I cannot

possibly leave until I have seen the machine.’

“‘It is not worth your while to wait,’ she went on. ‘You can pass

through the door; no one hinders.’ And then, seeing that I smiled and

shook my head, she suddenly threw aside her constraint and made a step

forward, with her hands wrung together. ‘For the love of Heaven!’ she

whispered, ‘get away from here before it is too late!’

“But I am somewhat headstrong by nature, and the more ready to engage

in an affair when there is some obstacle in the way. I thought of my

fifty-guinea fee, of my wearisome journey, and of the unpleasant night

which seemed to be before me. Was it all to go for nothing? Why should

I slink away without having carried out my commission, and without the

payment which was my due? This woman might, for all I knew, be a

monomaniac. With a stout bearing, therefore, though her manner had

shaken me more than I cared to confess, I still shook my head and

declared my intention of remaining where I was. She was about to renew

her entreaties when a door slammed overhead, and the sound of several

footsteps was heard upon the stairs. She listened for an instant, threw

up her hands with a despairing gesture, and vanished as suddenly and as

noiselessly as she had come.

“The newcomers were Colonel Lysander Stark and a short thick man with a

chinchilla beard growing out of the creases of his double chin, who was

introduced to me as Mr. Ferguson.

“‘This is my secretary and manager,’ said the colonel. ‘By the way, I

was under the impression that I left this door shut just now. I fear

that you have felt the draught.’

“‘On the contrary,’ said I, ‘I opened the door myself because I felt

the room to be a little close.’

“He shot one of his suspicious looks at me. ‘Perhaps we had better

proceed to business, then,’ said he. ‘Mr. Ferguson and I will take you

up to see the machine.’

“‘I had better put my hat on, I suppose.’

“‘Oh, no, it is in the house.’

“‘What, you dig fuller’s-earth in the house?’

“‘No, no. This is only where we compress it. But never mind that. All

we wish you to do is to examine the machine and to let us know what is

wrong with it.’

“We went upstairs together, the colonel first with the lamp, the fat

manager and I behind him. It was a labyrinth of an old house, with

corridors, passages, narrow winding staircases, and little low doors,

the thresholds of which were hollowed out by the generations who had

crossed them. There were no carpets and no signs of any furniture above

the ground floor, while the plaster was peeling off the walls, and the

damp was breaking through in green, unhealthy blotches. I tried to put

on as unconcerned an air as possible, but I had not forgotten the

warnings of the lady, even though I disregarded them, and I kept a keen

eye upon my two companions. Ferguson appeared to be a morose and silent

man, but I could see from the little that he said that he was at least

a fellow-countryman.

“Colonel Lysander Stark stopped at last before a low door, which he

unlocked. Within was a small, square room, in which the three of us

could hardly get at one time. Ferguson remained outside, and the

colonel ushered me in.

“‘We are now,’ said he, ‘actually within the hydraulic press, and it

would be a particularly unpleasant thing for us if anyone were to turn

it on. The ceiling of this small chamber is really the end of the

descending piston, and it comes down with the force of many tons upon

this metal floor. There are small lateral columns of water outside

which receive the force, and which transmit and multiply it in the

manner which is familiar to you. The machine goes readily enough, but

there is some stiffness in the working of it, and it has lost a little

of its force. Perhaps you will have the goodness to look it over and to

show us how we can set it right.’

“I took the lamp from him, and I examined the machine very thoroughly.

It was indeed a gigantic one, and capable of exercising enormous

pressure. When I passed outside, however, and pressed down the levers

which controlled it, I knew at once by the whishing sound that there

was a slight leakage, which allowed a regurgitation of water through

one of the side cylinders. An examination showed that one of the

india-rubber bands which was round the head of a driving-rod had shrunk

so as not quite to fill the socket along which it worked. This was

clearly the cause of the loss of power, and I pointed it out to my

companions, who followed my remarks very carefully and asked several

practical questions as to how they should proceed to set it right. When

I had made it clear to them, I returned to the main chamber of the

machine and took a good look at it to satisfy my own curiosity. It was

obvious at a glance that the story of the fuller’s-earth was the merest

fabrication, for it would be absurd to suppose that so powerful an

engine could be designed for so inadequate a purpose. The walls were of

wood, but the floor consisted of a large iron trough, and when I came

to examine it I could see a crust of metallic deposit all over it. I

had stooped and was scraping at this to see exactly what it was when I

heard a muttered exclamation in German and saw the cadaverous face of

the colonel looking down at me.

“‘What are you doing there?’ he asked.

“I felt angry at having been tricked by so elaborate a story as that

which he had told me. ‘I was admiring your fuller’s-earth,’ said I; ‘I

think that I should be better able to advise you as to your machine if

I knew what the exact purpose was for which it was used.’

“The instant that I uttered the words I regretted the rashness of my

speech. His face set hard, and a baleful light sprang up in his grey

eyes.

“‘Very well,’ said he, ‘you shall know all about the machine.’ He took

a step backward, slammed the little door, and turned the key in the', 2752)

secure, and did not give in the least to my kicks and shoves. ‘Hullo!’

I yelled. ‘Hullo! Colonel! Let me out!’

“And then suddenly in the silence I heard a sound which sent my heart

into my mouth. It was the clank of the levers and the swish of the

leaking cylinder. He had set the engine at work. The lamp still stood

upon the floor where I had placed it when examining the trough. By its

light I saw that the black ceiling was coming down upon me, slowly,

jerkily, but, as none knew better than myself, with a force which must

within a minute grind me to a shapeless pulp. I threw myself,

screaming, against the door, and dragged with my nails at the lock. I

implored the colonel to let me out, but the remorseless clanking of the

levers drowned my cries. The ceiling was only a foot or two above my

head, and with my hand upraised I could feel its hard, rough surface.

Then it flashed through my mind that the pain of my death would depend

very much upon the position in which I met it. If I lay on my face the

weight would come upon my spine, and I shuddered to think of that

dreadful snap. Easier the other way, perhaps; and yet, had I the nerve

to lie and look up at that deadly black shadow wavering down upon me?

Already I was unable to stand erect, when my eye caught something which

brought a gush of hope back to my heart.

“I have said that though the floor and ceiling were of iron, the walls

were of wood. As I gave a last hurried glance around, I saw a thin line

of yellow light between two of the boards, which broadened and

broadened as a small panel was pushed backward. For an instant I could

hardly believe that here was indeed a door which led away from death.

The next instant I threw myself through, and lay half-fainting upon the

other side. The panel had closed again behind me, but the crash of the

lamp, and a few moments afterwards the clang of the two slabs of metal,

told me how narrow had been my escape.

“I was recalled to myself by a frantic plucking at my wrist, and I

found myself lying upon the stone floor of a narrow corridor, while a

woman bent over me and tugged at me with her left hand, while she held

a candle in her right. It was the same good friend whose warning I had

so foolishly rejected.

“‘Come! come!’ she cried breathlessly. ‘They will be here in a moment.

They will see that you are not there. Oh, do not waste the so-precious

time, but come!’

“This time, at least, I did not scorn her advice. I staggered to my

feet and ran with her along the corridor and down a winding stair. The

latter led to another broad passage, and just as we reached it we heard

the sound of running feet and the shouting of two voices, one answering

the other from the floor on which  we were and from the one beneath. My

guide stopped and looked about her like one  who is at her wit’s end.

Then she threw open a door which led into a bedroom, through the window

of which the moon was shining brightly.

“‘It is your only chance,’ said she. ‘It is high, but it may be that

you can jump it.’

“As she spoke a light sprang into view at the further end of the

passage, and I saw the lean figure of Colonel Lysander Stark rushing

forward with a lantern in one hand and a weapon like a butcher’s

cleaver in the other. I rushed across the bedroom, flung open the

window, and looked out. How quiet and sweet and wholesome the garden

looked in the moonlight, and it could not be more than thirty feet

down. I clambered out upon the sill, but I hesitated to jump until I

should have heard what passed between my saviour and the ruffian who

pursued me. If she were ill-used, then at any risks I was determined to

go back to her assistance. The thought had hardly flashed through my

mind before he was at the door, pushing his way past her; but she threw

her arms round him and tried to hold him back.

“‘Fritz! Fritz!’ she cried in English, ‘remember your promise after the

last time. You said it should not be again. He will be silent! Oh, he

will be silent!’

“‘You are mad, Elise!’ he shouted, struggling to break away from her.

‘You will be the ruin of us. He has seen too much. Let me pass, I say!’

He dashed her to one side, and, rushing to the window, cut at me with

his heavy weapon. I had let myself go, and was hanging by the hands to

the sill, when his blow fell. I was conscious of a dull pain, my grip

loosened, and I fell into the garden below.

“I was shaken but not hurt by the fall; so I picked myself up and

rushed off among the bushes as hard as I could run, for I understood

that I was far from being out of danger yet. Suddenly, however, as I

ran, a deadly dizziness and sickness came over me. I glanced down at my

hand, which was throbbing painfully, and then, for the first time, saw

that my thumb had been cut off and that the blood was pouring from my

wound. I endeavoured to tie my handkerchief round it, but there came a

sudden buzzing in my ears, and next moment I fell in a dead faint among

the rose-bushes.

“How long I remained unconscious I cannot tell. It must have been a

very long time, for the moon had sunk, and a bright morning was

breaking when I came to myself. My clothes were all sodden with dew,

and my coat-sleeve was drenched with blood from my wounded thumb. The

smarting of it recalled in an instant all the particulars of my night’s

adventure, and I sprang to my feet with the feeling that I might hardly

yet be safe from my pursuers. But to my astonishment, when I came to

look round me, neither house nor garden were to be seen. I had been

lying in an angle of the hedge close by the high road, and just a little

lower down was a long building, which proved, upon my approaching it,

to be the very station at which I had arrived upon the previous night.

Were it not for the ugly wound upon my hand, all that had passed during

those dreadful hours might have been an evil dream.

“Half dazed, I went into the station and asked about the morning train.

There would be one to Reading in less than an hour. The same porter was

on duty, I found, as had been there when I arrived. I inquired of him

whether he had ever heard of Colonel Lysander Stark. The name was

strange to him. Had he observed a carriage the night before waiting for

me? No, he had not. Was there a police-station anywhere near? There was

one about three miles off.

“It was too far for me to go, weak and ill as I was. I determined to

wait until I got back to town before telling my story to the police. It

was a little past six when I arrived, so I went first to have my wound

dressed, and then the doctor was kind enough to bring me along here. I

put the case into your hands and shall do exactly what you advise.”

We both sat in silence for some little time after listening to this

extraordinary narrative. Then Sherlock Holmes pulled down from the

shelf one of the ponderous commonplace books in which he placed his

cuttings.

“Here is an advertisement which will interest you,” said he. “It

appeared in all the papers about a year ago. Listen to this: ‘Lost, on

the 9th inst., Mr. Jeremiah Hayling, aged twenty-six, a hydraulic

engineer. Left his lodgings at ten o’clock at night, and has not been

heard of since. Was dressed in,’ etc., etc. Ha! That represents the

last time that the colonel needed to have his machine overhauled, I

fancy.”

“Good heavens!” cried my patient. “Then that explains what the girl

said.”

“Undoubtedly. It is quite clear that the colonel was a cool and

desperate man, who was absolutely determined that nothing should stand

in the way of his little game, like those out-and-out pirates who will

leave no survivor from a captured ship. Well, every moment now is

precious, so if you feel equal to it we shall go down to Scotland Yard

at once as a preliminary to starting for Eyford.”

Some three hours or so afterwards we were all in the train together,

bound from Reading to the little Berkshire village. There were Sherlock

Holmes, the hydraulic engineer, Inspector Bradstreet, of Scotland Yard,

a plain-clothes man, and myself. Bradstreet had spread an ordnance map

of the county out upon the seat and was busy with his compasses drawing

a circle with Eyford for its centre.

“There you are,” said he. “That circle is drawn at a radius of ten

miles from the village. The place we want must be somewhere near that

line. You said ten miles, I think, sir.”

“It was an hour’s good drive.”

“And you think that they brought you back all that way when you were

unconscious?”

“They must have done so. I have a confused memory, too, of having been

lifted and conveyed somewhere.”

“What I cannot understand,” said I, “is why they should have spared you

when they found you lying fainting in the garden. Perhaps the villain

was softened by the woman’s entreaties.”

“I hardly think that likely. I never saw a more inexorable face in my

life.”

“Oh, we shall soon clear up all that,” said Bradstreet. “Well, I have

drawn my circle, and I only wish I knew at what point upon it the folk

that we are in search of are to be found.”

“I think I could lay my finger on it,” said Holmes quietly.

“Really, now!” cried the inspector, “you have formed your opinion!

Come, now, we shall see who agrees with you. I say it is south, for the

country is more deserted there.”

“And I say east,” said my patient.

“I am for west,” remarked the plain-clothes man. “There are several

quiet little villages up there.”

“And I am for north,” said I, “because there are no hills there, and

our friend says that he did not notice the carriage go up any.”

“Come,” cried the inspector, laughing; “it’s a very pretty diversity of

opinion. We have boxed the compass among us. Who do you give your

casting vote to?”

“You are all wrong.”

“But we can’t all be.”

“Oh, yes, you can. This is my point.” He placed his finger in the

centre of the circle. “This is where we shall find them.”

“But the twelve-mile drive?” gasped Hatherley.

“Six out and six back. Nothing simpler. You say yourself that the horse

was fresh and glossy when you got in. How could it be that if it had

gone twelve miles over heavy roads?”

“Indeed, it is a likely ruse enough,” observed Bradstreet thoughtfully.

“Of course there can be no doubt as to the nature of this gang.”

“None at all,” said Holmes. “They are coiners on a large scale, and

have used the machine to form the amalgam which has taken the place of

silver.”

“We have known for some time that a clever gang was at work,” said the

inspector. “They have been turning out half-crowns by the thousand. We

even traced them as far as Reading, but could get no farther, for they

had covered their traces in a way that showed that they were very old

hands. But now, thanks to this lucky chance, I think that we have got

them right enough.”

But the inspector was mistaken, for those criminals were not destined

to fall into the hands of justice. As we rolled into Eyford Station we

saw a gigantic column of smoke which streamed up from behind a small

clump of trees in the neighbourhood and hung like an immense ostrich

feather over the landscape.

“A house on fire?” asked Bradstreet as the train steamed off again on

its way.

“Yes, sir!” said the station-master.

“When did it break out?”

“I hear that it was during the night, sir, but it has got worse, and

the whole place is in a blaze.”

“Whose house is it?”

“Dr. Becher’s.”

“Tell me,” broke in the engineer, “is Dr. Becher a German, very thin,

with a long, sharp nose?”

The station-master laughed heartily. “No, sir, Dr. Becher is an

Englishman, and there isn’t a man in the parish who has a better-lined

waistcoat. But he has a gentleman staying with him, a patient, as I

understand, who is a foreigner, and he looks as if a little good

Berkshire beef would do him no harm.”

The station-master had not finished his speech before we were all

hastening in the direction of the fire. The road topped a low hill, and

there was a great widespread whitewashed building in front of us,

spouting fire at every chink and window, while in the garden in front

three fire-engines were vainly striving to keep the flames under.

“That’s it!” cried Hatherley, in intense excitement. “There is the

gravel-drive, and there are the rose-bushes where I lay. That second

window is the one that I jumped from.”

“Well, at least,” said Holmes, “you have had your revenge upon them.

There can be no question that it was your oil-lamp which, when it was

crushed in the press, set fire to the wooden walls, though no doubt

they were too excited in the chase after you to observe it at the time.

Now keep your eyes open in this crowd for your friends of last night,

though I very much fear that they are a good hundred miles off by now.”

And Holmes’ fears came to be realised, for from that day to this no

word has ever been heard either of the beautiful woman, the sinister

German, or the morose Englishman. Early that morning a peasant had met

a cart containing several people and some very bulky boxes driving

rapidly in the direction of Reading, but there all traces of the

fugitives disappeared, and even Holmes’ ingenuity failed ever to

discover the least clue as to their whereabouts.

The firemen had been much perturbed at the strange arrangements which

they had found within, and still more so by discovering a newly severed

human thumb upon a window-sill of the second floor. About sunset,

however, their efforts were at last successful, and they subdued the

flames, but not before the roof had fallen in, and the whole place been

reduced to such absolute ruin that, save some twisted cylinders and

iron piping, not a trace remained of the machinery which had cost our

unfortunate acquaintance so dearly. Large masses of nickel and of tin

were discovered stored in an out-house, but no coins were to be found,

which may have explained the presence of those bulky boxes which have

been already referred to.

How our hydraulic engineer had been conveyed from the garden to the

spot where he recovered his senses might have remained forever a

mystery were it not for the soft mould, which told us a very plain

tale. He had evidently been carried down by two persons, one of whom

had remarkably small feet and the other unusually large ones. On the

whole, it was most probable that the silent Englishman, being less bold

or less murderous than his companion, had assisted the woman to bear

the unconscious man out of the way of danger.

“Well,” said our engineer ruefully as we took our seats to return once

more to London, “it has been a pretty business for me! I have lost my

thumb and I have lost a fifty-guinea fee, and what have I gained?”

“Experience,” said Holmes, laughing. “Indirectly it may be of value,

you know; you have only to put it into words to gain the reputation of

being excellent company for the remainder of your existence.”', 2771)

ceased to be a subject of interest in those exalted circles in which

the unfortunate bridegroom moves. Fresh scandals have eclipsed it, and

their more piquant details have drawn the gossips away from this

four-year-old drama. As I have reason to believe, however, that the

full facts have never been revealed to the general public, and as my

friend Sherlock Holmes had a considerable share in clearing the matter

up, I feel that no memoir of him would be complete without some little

sketch of this remarkable episode.

It was a few weeks before my own marriage, during the days when I was

still sharing rooms with Holmes in Baker Street, that he came home from

an afternoon stroll to find a letter on the table waiting for him. I

had remained indoors all day, for the weather had taken a sudden turn

to rain, with high autumnal winds, and the jezail bullet which I had

brought back in one of my limbs as a relic of my Afghan campaign

throbbed with dull persistence. With my body in one easy-chair and my

legs upon another, I had surrounded myself with a cloud of newspapers

until at last, saturated with the news of the day, I tossed them all

aside and lay listless, watching the huge crest and monogram upon the

envelope upon the table and wondering lazily who my friend’s noble

correspondent could be.

“Here is a very fashionable epistle,” I remarked as he entered. “Your

morning letters, if I remember right, were from a fish-monger and a

tide-waiter.”

“Yes, my correspondence has certainly the charm of variety,” he

answered, smiling, “and the humbler are usually the more interesting.

This looks like one of those unwelcome social summonses which call upon

a man either to be bored or to lie.”

He broke the seal and glanced over the contents.

“Oh, come, it may prove to be something of interest, after all.”

“Not social, then?”

“No, distinctly professional.”

“And from a noble client?”

“One of the highest in England.”

“My dear fellow, I congratulate you.”

“I assure you, Watson, without affectation, that the status of my

client is a matter of less moment to me than the interest of his case.

It is just possible, however, that that also may not be wanting in this

new investigation. You have been reading the papers diligently of late,

have you not?”

“It looks like it,” said I ruefully, pointing to a huge bundle in the

corner. “I have had nothing else to do.”

“It is fortunate, for you will perhaps be able to post me up. I read

nothing except the criminal news and the agony column. The latter is

always instructive. But if you have followed recent events so closely

you must have read about Lord St. Simon and his wedding?”

“Oh, yes, with the deepest interest.”

“That is well. The letter which I hold in my hand is from Lord St.

Simon. I will read it to you, and in return you must turn over these

papers and let me have whatever bears upon the matter. This is what he

says:

    “‘MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES,—Lord Backwater tells me that I may

    place implicit reliance upon your judgment and discretion. I have

    determined, therefore, to call upon you and to consult you in

    reference to the very painful event which has occurred in

    connection with my wedding. Mr. Lestrade, of Scotland Yard, is

    acting already in the matter, but he assures me that he sees no

    objection to your co-operation, and that he even thinks that it

    might be of some assistance. I will call at four o’clock in the

    afternoon, and, should you have any other engagement at that time,

    I hope that you will postpone it, as this matter is of paramount

    importance. Yours faithfully,

    “‘ROBERT ST. SIMON.’

“It is dated from Grosvenor Mansions, written with a quill pen, and the

noble lord has had the misfortune to get a smear of ink upon the outer

side of his right little finger,” remarked Holmes as he folded up the

epistle.

“He says four o’clock. It is three now. He will be here in an hour.”

“Then I have just time, with your assistance, to get clear upon the

subject. Turn over those papers and arrange the extracts in their order

of time, while I take a glance as to who our client is.” He picked a

red-covered volume from a line of books of reference beside the

mantelpiece. “Here he is,” said he, sitting down and flattening it out

upon his knee. “‘Lord Robert Walsingham de Vere St. Simon, second son

of the Duke of Balmoral.’ Hum! ‘Arms: Azure, three caltrops in chief

over a fess sable. Born in 1846.’ He’s forty-one years of age, which is

mature for marriage. Was Under-Secretary for the colonies in a late

administration. The Duke, his father, was at one time Secretary for

Foreign Affairs. They inherit Plantagenet blood by direct descent, and

Tudor on the distaff side. Ha! Well, there is nothing very instructive

in all this. I think that I must turn to you Watson, for something more

solid.”

“I have very little difficulty in finding what I want,” said I, “for

the facts are quite recent, and the matter struck me as remarkable. I

feared to refer them to you, however, as I knew that you had an inquiry

on hand and that you disliked the intrusion of other matters.”

“Oh, you mean the little problem of the Grosvenor Square furniture van.

That is quite cleared up now—though, indeed, it was obvious from the

first. Pray give me the results of your newspaper selections.”

“Here is the first notice which I can find. It is in the personal

column of the _Morning Post_, and dates, as you see, some weeks back:

‘A marriage has been arranged,’ it says, ‘and will, if rumour is

correct, very shortly take place, between Lord Robert St. Simon, second

son of the Duke of Balmoral, and Miss Hatty Doran, the only daughter of

Aloysius Doran. Esq., of San Francisco, Cal., U.S.A.’ That is all.”

“Terse and to the point,” remarked Holmes, stretching his long, thin

legs towards the fire.

“There was a paragraph amplifying this in one of the society papers of

the same week. Ah, here it is: ‘There will soon be a call for

protection in the marriage  market, for the present free-trade

principle appears to tell heavily against our home product. One by one

the management of the noble houses of Great Britain is passing into the

hands of our fair cousins from across the Atlantic. An important

addition has been made during the last week to the list of the prizes

which have been borne away by these charming invaders. Lord St. Simon,

who has shown himself for over twenty years proof against the little

god’s arrows, has now definitely announced his approaching marriage

with Miss Hatty Doran, the fascinating daughter of a California

millionaire. Miss Doran, whose graceful figure and striking face

attracted much attention at the Westbury House festivities, is an only

child, and it is currently reported that her dowry will run to

considerably over the six figures, with expectancies for the future. As

it is an open secret that the Duke of Balmoral has been compelled to

sell his pictures within the last few years, and as Lord St. Simon has

no property of his own save the small estate of Birchmoor, it is

obvious that the Californian heiress is not the only gainer by an

alliance which will enable her to make the easy and common transition

from a Republican lady to a British peeress.’”

“Anything else?” asked Holmes, yawning.

“Oh, yes; plenty. Then there is another note in the _Morning Post_ to

say that the marriage would be an absolutely quiet one, that it would

be at St. George’s, Hanover Square, that only half a dozen intimate

friends would be invited, and that the party would return to the

furnished house at Lancaster Gate which has been taken by Mr. Aloysius

Doran. Two days later—that is, on Wednesday last—there is a curt

announcement that the wedding had taken place, and that the honeymoon

would be passed at Lord Backwater’s place, near Petersfield. Those are

all the notices which appeared before the disappearance of the bride.”

“Before the what?” asked Holmes with a start.

“The vanishing of the lady.”

“When did she vanish, then?”

“At the wedding breakfast.”

“Indeed. This is more interesting than it promised to be; quite

dramatic, in fact.”

“Yes; it struck me as being a little out of the common.”

“They often vanish before the ceremony, and occasionally during the

honeymoon; but I cannot call to mind anything quite so prompt as this.

Pray let me have the details.”

“I warn you that they are very incomplete.”

“Perhaps we may make them less so.”

“Such as they are, they are set forth in a single article of a morning

paper of yesterday, which I will read to you. It is headed, ‘Singular

Occurrence at a Fashionable Wedding’:

“‘The family of Lord Robert St. Simon has been thrown into the greatest

consternation by the strange and painful episodes which have taken

place in connection with his wedding. The ceremony, as shortly

announced in the papers of yesterday, occurred on the previous morning;

but it is only now that it has been possible to confirm the strange

rumours which have been so persistently floating about. In spite of the

attempts of the friends to hush the matter up, so much public attention

has now been drawn to it that no good purpose can be served by

affecting to disregard what is a common subject for conversation.

“‘The ceremony, which was performed at St. George’s, Hanover Square,

was a very quiet one, no one being present save the father of the

bride, Mr. Aloysius Doran, the Duchess of Balmoral, Lord Backwater,

Lord Eustace and Lady Clara St. Simon (the younger brother and sister

of the bridegroom), and Lady Alicia Whittington. The whole party

proceeded afterwards to the house of Mr. Aloysius Doran, at Lancaster

Gate, where breakfast had been prepared. It appears that some little

trouble was caused by a woman, whose name has not been ascertained, who

endeavoured to force her way into the house after the bridal party,

alleging that she had some claim upon Lord St. Simon. It was only after

a painful and prolonged scene that she was ejected by the butler and

the footman. The bride, who had fortunately entered the house before

this unpleasant interruption, had sat down to breakfast with the rest,

when she complained of a sudden indisposition and retired to her room.

Her prolonged absence having caused some comment, her father followed

her, but learned from her maid that she had only come up to her chamber

for an instant, caught up an ulster and bonnet, and hurried down to the

passage. One of the footmen declared that he had seen a lady leave the

house thus apparelled, but had refused to credit that it was his

mistress, believing her to be with the company. On ascertaining that

his daughter had disappeared, Mr. Aloysius Doran, in conjunction with

the bridegroom, instantly put themselves in communication with the

police, and very energetic inquiries are being made, which will

probably result in a speedy clearing up of this very singular business.

Up to a late hour last night, however, nothing had transpired as to the

whereabouts of the missing lady. There are rumours of foul play in the

matter, and it is said that the police have caused the arrest of the

woman who had caused the original disturbance, in the belief that, from

jealousy or some other motive, she may have been concerned in the

strange disappearance of the bride.’”

“And is that all?”

“Only one little item in another of the morning papers, but it is a

suggestive one.”

“And it is—”

“That Miss Flora Millar, the lady who had caused the disturbance, has

actually been arrested. It appears that she was formerly a _danseuse_

at the Allegro, and that she has known the bridegroom for some years.

There are no further particulars, and the whole case is in your hands

now—so far as it has been set forth in the public press.”

“And an exceedingly interesting case it appears to be. I would not have

missed it for worlds. But there is a ring at the bell, Watson, and as

the clock makes it a few minutes after four, I have no doubt that this

will prove to be our noble client. Do not dream of going, Watson, for I

very much prefer having a witness, if only as a check to my own

memory.”

“Lord Robert St. Simon,” announced our page-boy, throwing open the

door. A gentleman entered, with a pleasant, cultured face, high-nosed

and pale, with something perhaps of petulance about the mouth, and with

the steady, well-opened eye of a man whose pleasant lot it had ever

been to command and to be obeyed. His manner was brisk, and yet his

general appearance gave an undue impression of age, for he had a slight

forward stoop and a little bend of the knees as he walked. His hair,

too, as he swept off his very curly-brimmed hat, was grizzled round the

edges and thin upon the top. As to his dress, it was careful to the

verge of foppishness, with high collar, black frock-coat, white

waistcoat, yellow gloves, patent-leather shoes, and light-coloured

gaiters. He advanced slowly into the room, turning his head from left

to right, and swinging in his right hand the cord which held his golden

eyeglasses.

“Good-day, Lord St. Simon,” said Holmes, rising and bowing. “Pray take

the basket-chair. This is my friend and colleague, Dr. Watson. Draw up

a little to the fire, and we will talk this matter over.”

“A most painful matter to me, as you can most readily imagine, Mr.

Holmes. I have been cut to the quick. I understand that you have

already managed several delicate cases of this sort, sir, though I

presume that they were hardly from the same class of society.”

“No, I am descending.”

“I beg pardon.”

“My last client of the sort was a king.”

“Oh, really! I had no idea. And which king?”

“The King of Scandinavia.”

“What! Had he lost his wife?”

“You can understand,” said Holmes suavely, “that I extend to the

affairs of my other clients the same secrecy which I promise to you in

yours.”

“Of course! Very right! very right! I’m sure I beg pardon. As to my own

case, I am ready to give you any information which may assist you in

forming an opinion.”

“Thank you. I have already learned all that is in the public prints,

nothing more. I presume that I may take it as correct—this article, for

example, as to the disappearance of the bride.”

Lord St. Simon glanced over it. “Yes, it is correct, as far as it

goes.”

“But it needs a great deal of supplementing before anyone could offer

an opinion. I think that I may arrive at my facts most directly by

questioning you.”

“Pray do so.”

“When did you first meet Miss Hatty Doran?”

“In San Francisco, a year ago.”

“You were travelling in the States?”

“Yes.”

“Did you become engaged then?”

“No.”

“But you were on a friendly footing?”

“I was amused by her society, and she could see that I was amused.”

“Her father is very rich?”

“He is said to be the richest man on the Pacific slope.”

“And how did he make his money?”

“In mining. He had nothing a few years ago. Then he struck gold,

invested it, and came up by leaps and bounds.”

“Now, what is your own impression as to the young lady’s—your wife’s

character?”

The nobleman swung his glasses a little faster and stared down into the

fire. “You see, Mr. Holmes,” said he, “my wife was twenty before her', 2687)

camp and wandered through woods or mountains, so that her education has

come from Nature rather than from the schoolmaster. She is what we call

in England a tomboy, with a strong nature, wild and free, unfettered by

any sort of traditions. She is impetuous—volcanic, I was about to say.

She is swift in making up her mind and fearless in carrying out her

resolutions. On the other hand, I would not have given her the name

which I have the honour to bear”—he gave a little stately cough—“had I

not thought her to be at bottom a noble woman. I believe that she is

capable of heroic self-sacrifice and that anything dishonourable would

be repugnant to her.”

“Have you her photograph?”

“I brought this with me.” He opened a locket and showed us the full

face of a very lovely woman. It was not a photograph but an ivory

miniature, and the artist had brought out the full effect of the

lustrous black hair, the large dark eyes, and the exquisite mouth.

Holmes gazed long and earnestly at it. Then he closed the locket and

handed it back to Lord St. Simon.

“The young lady came to London, then, and you renewed your

acquaintance?”

“Yes, her father brought her over for this last London season. I met

her several times, became engaged to her, and have now married her.”

“She brought, I understand, a considerable dowry?”

“A fair dowry. Not more than is usual in my family.”

“And this, of course, remains to you, since the marriage is a _fait

accompli_?”

“I really have made no inquiries on the subject.”

“Very naturally not. Did you see Miss Doran on the day before the

wedding?”

“Yes.”

“Was she in good spirits?”

“Never better. She kept talking of what we should do in our future

lives.”

“Indeed! That is very interesting. And on the morning of the wedding?”

“She was as bright as possible—at least until after the ceremony.”

“And did you observe any change in her then?”

“Well, to tell the truth, I saw then the first signs that I had ever

seen that her temper was just a little sharp. The incident however, was

too trivial to relate and can have no possible bearing upon the case.”

“Pray let us have it, for all that.”

“Oh, it is childish. She dropped her bouquet as we went towards the

vestry. She was passing the front pew at the time, and it fell over

into the pew. There was a moment’s delay, but the gentleman in the pew

handed it up to her again, and it did not appear to be the worse for

the fall. Yet when I spoke to her of the matter, she answered me

abruptly; and in the carriage, on our way home, she seemed absurdly

agitated over this trifling cause.”

“Indeed! You say that there was a gentleman in the pew. Some of the

general public were present, then?”

“Oh, yes. It is impossible to exclude them when the church is open.”

“This gentleman was not one of your wife’s friends?”

“No, no; I call him a gentleman by courtesy, but he was quite a

common-looking person. I hardly noticed his appearance. But really I

think that we are wandering rather far from the point.”

“Lady St. Simon, then, returned from the wedding in a less cheerful

frame of mind than she had gone to it. What did she do on re-entering

her father’s house?”

“I saw her in conversation with her maid.”

“And who is her maid?”

“Alice is her name. She is an American and came from California with

her.”

“A confidential servant?”

“A little too much so. It seemed to me that her mistress allowed her to

take great liberties. Still, of course, in America they look upon these

things in a different way.”

“How long did she speak to this Alice?”

“Oh, a few minutes. I had something else to think of.”

“You did not overhear what they said?”

“Lady St. Simon said something about ‘jumping a claim.’ She was

accustomed to use slang of the kind. I have no idea what she meant.”

“American slang is very expressive sometimes. And what did your wife do

when she finished speaking to her maid?”

“She walked into the breakfast-room.”

“On your arm?”

“No, alone. She was very independent in little matters like that. Then,

after we had sat down for ten minutes or so, she rose hurriedly,

muttered some words of apology, and left the room. She never came

back.”

“But this maid, Alice, as I understand, deposes that she went to her

room, covered her bride’s dress with a long ulster, put on a bonnet,

and went out.”

“Quite so. And she was afterwards seen walking into Hyde Park in

company with Flora Millar, a woman who is now in custody, and who had

already made a disturbance at Mr. Doran’s house that morning.”

“Ah, yes. I should like a few particulars as to this young lady, and

your relations to her.”

Lord St. Simon shrugged his shoulders and raised his eyebrows. “We have

been on a friendly footing for some years—I may say on a _very_

friendly footing. She used to be at the Allegro. I have not treated her

ungenerously, and she had no just cause of complaint against me, but

you know what women are, Mr. Holmes. Flora was a dear little thing, but

exceedingly hot-headed and devotedly attached to me. She wrote me

dreadful letters when she heard that I was about to be married, and, to

tell the truth, the reason why I had the marriage celebrated so quietly

was that I feared lest there might be a scandal in the church. She came

to Mr. Doran’s door just after we returned, and she endeavoured to push

her way in, uttering very abusive expressions towards my wife, and even

threatening her, but I had foreseen the possibility of something of the

sort, and I had two police fellows there in private clothes, who soon

pushed her out again. She was quiet when she saw that there was no good

in making a row.”

“Did your wife hear all this?”

“No, thank goodness, she did not.”

“And she was seen walking with this very woman afterwards?”

“Yes. That is what Mr. Lestrade, of Scotland Yard, looks upon as so

serious. It is thought that Flora decoyed my wife out and laid some

terrible trap for her.”

“Well, it is a possible supposition.”

“You think so, too?”

“I did not say a probable one. But you do not yourself look upon this

as likely?”

“I do not think Flora would hurt a fly.”

“Still, jealousy is a strange transformer of characters. Pray what is

your own theory as to what took place?”

“Well, really, I came to seek a theory, not to propound one. I have

given you all the facts. Since you ask me, however, I may say that it

has occurred to me as possible that the excitement of this affair, the

consciousness that she had made so immense a social stride, had the

effect of causing some little nervous disturbance in my wife.”

“In short, that she had become suddenly deranged?”

“Well, really, when I consider that she has turned her back—I will not

say upon me, but upon so much that many have aspired to without

success—I can hardly explain it in any other fashion.”

“Well, certainly that is also a conceivable hypothesis,” said Holmes,

smiling. “And now, Lord St. Simon, I think that I have nearly all my

data. May I ask whether you were seated at the breakfast-table so that

you could see out of the window?”

“We could see the other side of the road and the Park.”

“Quite so. Then I do not think that I need to detain you longer. I

shall communicate with you.”

“Should you be fortunate enough to solve this problem,” said our

client, rising.

“I have solved it.”

“Eh? What was that?”

“I say that I have solved it.”

“Where, then, is my wife?”

“That is a detail which I shall speedily supply.”

Lord St. Simon shook his head. “I am afraid that it will take wiser

heads than yours or mine,” he remarked, and bowing in a stately,

old-fashioned manner he departed.

“It is very good of Lord St. Simon to honour my head by putting it on a

level with his own,” said Sherlock Holmes, laughing. “I think that I

shall have a whisky and soda and a cigar after all this

cross-questioning. I had formed my conclusions as to the case before

our client came into the room.”

“My dear Holmes!”

“I have notes of several similar cases, though none, as I remarked

before, which were quite as prompt. My whole examination served to turn

my conjecture into a certainty. Circumstantial evidence is occasionally

very convincing, as when you find a trout in the milk, to quote

Thoreau’s example.”

“But I have heard all that you have heard.”

“Without, however, the knowledge of pre-existing cases which serves me

so well. There was a parallel instance in Aberdeen some years back, and

something on very much the same lines at Munich the year after the

Franco-Prussian War. It is one of these cases—but, hullo, here is

Lestrade! Good-afternoon, Lestrade! You will find an extra tumbler upon

the sideboard, and there are cigars in the box.”

The official detective was attired in a pea-jacket and cravat, which

gave him a decidedly nautical appearance, and he carried a black canvas

bag in his hand. With a short greeting he seated himself and lit the

cigar which had been offered to him.

“What’s up, then?” asked Holmes with a twinkle in his eye. “You look

dissatisfied.”

“And I feel dissatisfied. It is this infernal St. Simon marriage case.

I can make neither head nor tail of the business.”

“Really! You surprise me.”

“Who ever heard of such a mixed affair? Every clue seems to slip

through my fingers. I have been at work upon it all day.”

“And very wet it seems to have made you,” said Holmes laying his hand

upon the arm of the pea-jacket.

“Yes, I have been dragging the Serpentine.”

“In Heaven’s name, what for?”

“In search of the body of Lady St. Simon.”

Sherlock Holmes leaned back in his chair and laughed heartily.

“Have you dragged the basin of Trafalgar Square fountain?” he asked.

“Why? What do you mean?”

“Because you have just as good a chance of finding this lady in the one

as in the other.”

Lestrade shot an angry glance at my companion. “I suppose you know all

about it,” he snarled.

“Well, I have only just heard the facts, but my mind is made up.”

“Oh, indeed! Then you think that the Serpentine plays no part in the

matter?”

“I think it very unlikely.”

“Then perhaps you will kindly explain how it is that we found this in

it?” He opened his bag as he spoke, and tumbled onto the floor a

wedding-dress of watered silk, a pair of white satin shoes and a

bride’s wreath and veil, all discoloured and soaked in water. “There,”

said he, putting a new wedding-ring upon the top of the pile. “There is

a little nut for you to crack, Master Holmes.”

“Oh, indeed!” said my friend, blowing blue rings into the air. “You

dragged them from the Serpentine?”

“No. They were found floating near the margin by a park-keeper. They

have been identified as her clothes, and it seemed to me that if the

clothes were there the body would not be far off.”

“By the same brilliant reasoning, every man’s body is to be found in

the neighbourhood of his wardrobe. And pray what did you hope to arrive

at through this?”

“At some evidence implicating Flora Millar in the disappearance.”

“I am afraid that you will find it difficult.”

“Are you, indeed, now?” cried Lestrade with some bitterness. “I am

afraid, Holmes, that you are not very practical with your deductions

and your inferences. You have made two blunders in as many minutes.

This dress does implicate Miss Flora Millar.”

“And how?”

“In the dress is a pocket. In the pocket is a card-case. In the

card-case is a note. And here is the very note.” He slapped it down

upon the table in front of him. “Listen to this: ‘You will see me when

all is ready. Come at once. F. H. M.’ Now my theory all along has been

that Lady St. Simon was decoyed away by Flora Millar, and that she,

with confederates, no doubt, was responsible for her disappearance.

Here, signed with her initials, is the very note which was no doubt

quietly slipped into her hand at the door and which lured her within

their reach.”

“Very good, Lestrade,” said Holmes, laughing. “You really are very fine

indeed. Let me see it.” He took up the paper in a listless way, but his

attention instantly became riveted, and he gave a little cry of

satisfaction. “This is indeed important,” said he.

“Ha! you find it so?”

“Extremely so. I congratulate you warmly.”

Lestrade rose in his triumph and bent his head to look. “Why,” he

shrieked, “you’re looking at the wrong side!”

“On the contrary, this is the right side.”

“The right side? You’re mad! Here is the note written in pencil over

here.”

“And over here is what appears to be the fragment of a hotel bill,

which interests me deeply.”

“There’s nothing in it. I looked at it before,” said Lestrade. “‘Oct.

6_d_., glass sherry, 8_d_.’ I see nothing in that.”

“Very likely not. It is most important, all the same. As to the note,

it is important also, or at least the initials are, so I congratulate

you again.”

“I’ve wasted time enough,” said Lestrade, rising. “I believe in hard

work and not in sitting by the fire spinning fine theories. Good-day,

Mr. Holmes, and we shall see which gets to the bottom of the matter

first.” He gathered up the garments, thrust them into the bag, and made

for the door.

“Just one hint to you, Lestrade,” drawled Holmes before his rival

vanished; “I will tell you the true solution of the matter. Lady St.

Simon is a myth. There is not, and there never has been, any such

person.”

Lestrade looked sadly at my companion. Then he turned to me, tapped his

forehead three times, shook his head solemnly, and hurried away.

He had hardly shut the door behind him when Holmes rose to put on his

overcoat. “There is something in what the fellow says about outdoor

work,” he remarked, “so I think, Watson, that I must leave you to your

papers for a little.”

It was after five o’clock when Sherlock Holmes left me, but I had no

time to be lonely, for within an hour there arrived a confectioner’s

man with a very large flat box. This he unpacked with the help of a

youth whom he had brought with him, and presently, to my very great

astonishment, a quite epicurean little cold supper began to be laid out

upon our humble lodging-house mahogany. There were a couple of brace of

cold woodcock, a pheasant, a _pâté de foie gras_ pie with a group of

ancient and cobwebby bottles. Having laid out all these luxuries, my

two visitors vanished away, like the genii of the Arabian Nights, with

no explanation save that the things had been paid for and were ordered

to this address.

Just before nine o’clock Sherlock Holmes stepped briskly into the room.

His features were gravely set, but there was a light in his eye which

made me think that he had not been disappointed in his conclusions.

“They have laid the supper, then,” he said, rubbing his hands.

“You seem to expect company. They have laid for five.”

“Yes, I fancy we may have some company dropping in,” said he. “I am', 2694)

I hear his step now upon the stairs.”

It was indeed our visitor of the afternoon who came bustling in,

dangling his glasses more vigorously than ever, and with a very

perturbed expression upon his aristocratic features.

“My messenger reached you, then?” asked Holmes.

“Yes, and I confess that the contents startled me beyond measure. Have

you good authority for what you say?”

“The best possible.”

Lord St. Simon sank into a chair and passed his hand over his forehead.

“What will the Duke say,” he murmured, “when he hears that one of the

family has been subjected to such humiliation?”

“It is the purest accident. I cannot allow that there is any

humiliation.”

“Ah, you look on these things from another standpoint.”

“I fail to see that anyone is to blame. I can hardly see how the lady

could have acted otherwise, though her abrupt method of doing it was

undoubtedly to be regretted. Having no mother, she had no one to advise

her at such a crisis.”

“It was a slight, sir, a public slight,” said Lord St. Simon, tapping

his fingers upon the table.

“You must make allowance for this poor girl, placed in so unprecedented

a position.”

“I will make no allowance. I am very angry indeed, and I have been

shamefully used.”

“I think that I heard a ring,” said Holmes. “Yes, there are steps on

the landing. If I cannot persuade you to take a lenient view of the

matter, Lord St. Simon, I have brought an advocate here who may be more

successful.” He opened the door and ushered in a lady and gentleman.

“Lord St. Simon,” said he “allow me to introduce you to Mr. and Mrs.

Francis Hay Moulton. The lady, I think, you have already met.”

At the sight of these newcomers our client had sprung from his seat and

stood very erect, with his eyes cast down and his hand thrust into the

breast of his frock-coat, a picture of offended dignity. The lady had

taken a quick step forward and had held out her hand to him, but he

still refused to raise his eyes. It was as well for his resolution,

perhaps, for her pleading face was one which it was hard to resist.

“You’re angry, Robert,” said she. “Well, I guess you have every cause

to be.”

“Pray make no apology to me,” said Lord St. Simon bitterly.

“Oh, yes, I know that I have treated you real bad and that I should

have spoken to you before I went; but I was kind of rattled, and from

the time when I saw Frank here again I just didn’t know what I was

doing or saying. I only wonder I didn’t fall down and do a faint right

there before the altar.”

“Perhaps, Mrs. Moulton, you would like my friend and me to leave the

room while you explain this matter?”

“If I may give an opinion,” remarked the strange gentleman, “we’ve had

just a little too much secrecy over this business already. For my part,

I should like all Europe and America to hear the rights of it.” He was

a small, wiry, sunburnt man, clean-shaven, with a sharp face and alert

manner.

“Then I’ll tell our story right away,” said the lady. “Frank here and I

met in ’84, in McQuire’s camp, near the Rockies, where Pa was working a

claim. We were engaged to each other, Frank and I; but then one day

father struck a rich pocket and made a pile, while poor Frank here had

a claim that petered out and came to nothing. The richer Pa grew the

poorer was Frank; so at last Pa wouldn’t hear of our engagement lasting

any longer, and he took me away to ’Frisco. Frank wouldn’t throw up his

hand, though; so he followed me there, and he saw me without Pa knowing

anything about it. It would only have made him mad to know, so we just

fixed it all up for ourselves. Frank said that he would go and make his

pile, too, and never come back to claim me until he had as much as Pa.

So then I promised to wait for him to the end of time and pledged

myself not to marry anyone else while he lived. ‘Why shouldn’t we be

married right away, then,’ said he, ‘and then I will feel sure of you;

and I won’t claim to be your husband until I come back?’ Well, we

talked it over, and he had fixed it all up so nicely, with a clergyman

all ready in waiting, that we just did it right there; and then Frank

went off to seek his fortune, and I went back to Pa.

“The next I heard of Frank was that he was in Montana, and then he went

prospecting in Arizona, and then I heard of him from New Mexico. After

that came a long newspaper story about how a miners’ camp had been

attacked by Apache Indians, and there was my Frank’s name among the

killed. I fainted dead away, and I was very sick for months after. Pa

thought I had a decline and took me to half the doctors in ’Frisco. Not

a word of news came for a year and more, so that I never doubted that

Frank was really dead. Then Lord St. Simon came to ’Frisco, and we came

to London, and a marriage was arranged, and Pa was very pleased, but I

felt all the time that no man on this earth would ever take the place

in my heart that had been given to my poor Frank.

“Still, if I had married Lord St. Simon, of course I’d have done my

duty by him. We can’t command our love, but we can our actions. I went

to the altar with him with the intention to make him just as good a

wife as it was in me to be. But you may imagine what I felt when, just

as I came to the altar rails, I glanced back and saw Frank standing and

looking at me out of the first pew. I thought it was his ghost at

first; but when I looked again there he was still, with a kind of

question in his eyes, as if to ask me whether I were glad or sorry to

see him. I wonder I didn’t drop. I know that everything was turning

round, and the words of the clergyman were just like the buzz of a bee

in my ear. I didn’t know what to do. Should I stop the service and make

a scene in the church? I glanced at him again, and he seemed to know

what I was thinking, for he raised his finger to his lips to tell me to

be still. Then I saw him scribble on a piece of paper, and I knew that

he was writing me a note. As I passed his pew on the way out I dropped

my bouquet over to him, and he slipped the note into my hand when he

returned me the flowers. It was only a line asking me to join him when

he made the sign to me to do so. Of course I never doubted for a moment

that my first duty was now to him, and I determined to do just whatever

he might direct.

“When I got back I told my maid, who had known him in California, and

had always been his friend. I ordered her to say nothing, but to get a

few things packed and my ulster ready. I know I ought to have spoken to

Lord St. Simon, but it was dreadful hard before his mother and all

those great people. I just made up my mind to run away and explain

afterwards. I hadn’t been at the table ten minutes before I saw Frank

out of the window at the other side of the road. He beckoned to me and

then began walking into the Park. I slipped out, put on my things, and

followed him. Some woman came talking something or other about Lord St.

Simon to me—seemed to me from the little I heard as if he had a little

secret of his own before marriage also—but I managed to get away from

her and soon overtook Frank. We got into a cab together, and away we

drove to some lodgings he had taken in Gordon Square, and that was my

true wedding after all those years of waiting. Frank had been a

prisoner among the Apaches, had escaped, came on to ’Frisco, found that

I had given him up for dead and had gone to England, followed me there,

and had come upon me at last on the very morning of my second wedding.”

“I saw it in a paper,” explained the American. “It gave the name and

the church but not where the lady lived.”

“Then we had a talk as to what we should do, and Frank was all for

openness, but I was so ashamed of it all that I felt as if I should

like to vanish away and never see any of them again—just sending a line

to Pa, perhaps, to show him that I was alive. It was awful to me to

think of all those lords and ladies sitting round that breakfast-table

and waiting for me to come back. So Frank took my wedding-clothes and

things and made a bundle of them, so that I should not be traced, and

dropped them away somewhere where no one could find them. It is likely

that we should have gone on to Paris to-morrow, only that this good

gentleman, Mr. Holmes, came round to us this evening, though how he

found us is more than I can think, and he showed us very clearly and

kindly that I was wrong and that Frank was right, and that we should be

putting ourselves in the wrong if we were so secret. Then he offered to

give us a chance of talking to Lord St. Simon alone, and so we came

right away round to his rooms at once. Now, Robert, you have heard it

all, and I am very sorry if I have given you pain, and I hope that you

do not think very meanly of me.”

Lord St. Simon had by no means relaxed his rigid attitude, but had

listened with a frowning brow and a compressed lip to this long

narrative.

“Excuse me,” he said, “but it is not my custom to discuss my most

intimate personal affairs in this public manner.”

“Then you won’t forgive me? You won’t shake hands before I go?”

“Oh, certainly, if it would give you any pleasure.” He put out his hand

and coldly grasped that which she extended to him.

“I had hoped,” suggested Holmes, “that you would have joined us in a

friendly supper.”

“I think that there you ask a little too much,” responded his Lordship.

“I may be forced to acquiesce in these recent developments, but I can

hardly be expected to make merry over them. I think that with your

permission I will now wish you all a very good-night.” He included us

all in a sweeping bow and stalked out of the room.

“Then I trust that you at least will honour me with your company,” said

Sherlock Holmes. “It is always a joy to meet an American, Mr. Moulton,

for I am one of those who believe that the folly of a monarch and the

blundering of a minister in far-gone years will not prevent our

children from being some day citizens of the same world-wide country

under a flag which shall be a quartering of the Union Jack with the

Stars and Stripes.”

“The case has been an interesting one,” remarked Holmes when our

visitors had left us, “because it serves to show very clearly how

simple the explanation may be of an affair which at first sight seems

to be almost inexplicable. Nothing could be more natural than the

sequence of events as narrated by this lady, and nothing stranger than

the result when viewed, for instance, by Mr. Lestrade of Scotland

Yard.”

“You were not yourself at fault at all, then?”

“From the first, two facts were very obvious to me, the one that the

lady had been quite willing to undergo the wedding ceremony, the other

that she had repented of it within a few minutes of returning home.

Obviously something had occurred during the morning, then, to cause her

to change her mind. What could that something be? She could not have

spoken to anyone when she was out, for she had been in the company of

the bridegroom. Had she seen someone, then? If she had, it must be

someone from America because she had spent so short a time in this

country that she could hardly have allowed anyone to acquire so deep an

influence over her that the mere sight of him would induce her to

change her plans so completely. You see we have already arrived, by a

process of exclusion, at the idea that she might have seen an American.

Then who could this American be, and why should he possess so much

influence over her? It might be a lover; it might be a husband. Her

young womanhood had, I knew, been spent in rough scenes and under

strange conditions. So far I had got before I ever heard Lord St.

Simon’s narrative. When he told us of a man in a pew, of the change in

the bride’s manner, of so transparent a device for obtaining a note as

the dropping of a bouquet, of her resort to her confidential maid, and

of her very significant allusion to claim-jumping—which in miners’

parlance means taking possession of that which another person has a

prior claim to—the whole situation became absolutely clear. She had

gone off with a man, and the man was either a lover or was a previous

husband—the chances being in favour of the latter.”

“And how in the world did you find them?”

“It might have been difficult, but friend Lestrade held information in

his hands the value of which he did not himself know. The initials

were, of course, of the highest importance, but more valuable still was

it to know that within a week he had settled his bill at one of the

most select London hotels.”

“How did you deduce the select?”

“By the select prices. Eight shillings for a bed and eightpence for a

glass of sherry pointed to one of the most expensive hotels. There are

not many in London which charge at that rate. In the second one which I

visited in Northumberland Avenue, I learned by an inspection of the

book that Francis H. Moulton, an American gentleman, had left only the

day before, and on looking over the entries against him, I came upon

the very items which I had seen in the duplicate bill. His letters were

to be forwarded to 226 Gordon Square; so thither I travelled, and being

fortunate enough to find the loving couple at home, I ventured to give

them some paternal advice and to point out to them that it would be

better in every way that they should make their position a little

clearer both to the general public and to Lord St. Simon in particular.

I invited them to meet him here, and, as you see, I made him keep the

appointment.”

“But with no very good result,” I remarked. “His conduct was certainly

not very gracious.”

“Ah, Watson,” said Holmes, smiling, “perhaps you would not be very

gracious either, if, after all the trouble of wooing and wedding, you

found yourself deprived in an instant of wife and of fortune. I think

that we may judge Lord St. Simon very mercifully and thank our stars

that we are never likely to find ourselves in the same position. Draw

your chair up and hand me my violin, for the only problem we have still

to solve is how to while away these bleak autumnal evenings.”', 2721)

the street, “here is a madman coming along. It seems rather sad that

his relatives should allow him to come out alone.”

My friend rose lazily from his armchair and stood with his hands in the

pockets of his dressing-gown, looking over my shoulder. It was a

bright, crisp February morning, and the snow of the day before still

lay deep upon the ground, shimmering brightly in the wintry sun. Down

the centre of Baker Street it had been ploughed into a brown crumbly

band by the traffic, but at either side and on the heaped-up edges of

the footpaths it still lay as white as when it fell. The grey pavement

had been cleaned and scraped, but was still dangerously slippery, so

that there were fewer passengers than usual. Indeed, from the direction

of the Metropolitan Station no one was coming save the single gentleman

whose eccentric conduct had drawn my attention.

He was a man of about fifty, tall, portly, and imposing, with a

massive, strongly marked face and a commanding figure. He was dressed

in a sombre yet rich style, in black frock-coat, shining hat, neat

brown gaiters, and well-cut pearl-grey trousers. Yet his actions were

in absurd contrast to the dignity of his dress and features, for he was

running hard, with occasional little springs, such as a weary man gives

who is little accustomed to set any tax upon his legs. As he ran he

jerked his hands up and down, waggled his head, and writhed his face

into the most extraordinary contortions.

“What on earth can be the matter with him?” I asked. “He is looking up

at the numbers of the houses.”

“I believe that he is coming here,” said Holmes, rubbing his hands.

“Here?”

“Yes; I rather think he is coming to consult me professionally. I think

that I recognise the symptoms. Ha! did I not tell you?” As he spoke,

the man, puffing and blowing, rushed at our door and pulled at our bell

until the whole house resounded with the clanging.

A few moments later he was in our room, still puffing, still

gesticulating, but with so fixed a look of grief and despair in his

eyes that our smiles were turned in an instant to horror and pity. For

a while he could not get his words out, but swayed his body and plucked

at his hair like one who has been driven to the extreme limits of his

reason. Then, suddenly springing to his feet, he beat his head against

the wall with such force that we both rushed upon him and tore him away

to the centre of the room. Sherlock Holmes pushed him down into the

easy-chair and, sitting beside him, patted his hand and chatted with

him in the easy, soothing tones which he knew so well how to employ.

“You have come to me to tell your story, have you not?” said he. “You

are fatigued with your haste. Pray wait until you have recovered

yourself, and then I shall be most happy to look into any little

problem which you may submit to me.”

The man sat for a minute or more with a heaving chest, fighting against

his emotion. Then he passed his handkerchief over his brow, set his

lips tight, and turned his face towards us.

“No doubt you think me mad?” said he.

“I see that you have had some great trouble,” responded Holmes.

“God knows I have!—a trouble which is enough to unseat my reason, so

sudden and so terrible is it. Public disgrace I might have faced,

although I am a man whose character has never yet borne a stain.

Private affliction also is the lot of every man; but the two coming

together, and in so frightful a form, have been enough to shake my very

soul. Besides, it is not I alone. The very noblest in the land may

suffer unless some way be found out of this horrible affair.”

“Pray compose yourself, sir,” said Holmes, “and let me have a clear

account of who you are and what it is that has befallen you.”

“My name,” answered our visitor, “is probably familiar to your ears. I

am Alexander Holder, of the banking firm of Holder & Stevenson, of

Threadneedle Street.”

The name was indeed well known to us as belonging to the senior partner

in the second largest private banking concern in the City of London.

What could have happened, then, to bring one of the foremost citizens

of London to this most pitiable pass? We waited, all curiosity, until

with another effort he braced himself to tell his story.

“I feel that time is of value,” said he; “that is why I hastened here

when the police inspector suggested that I should secure your

co-operation. I came to Baker Street by the Underground and hurried

from there on foot, for the cabs go slowly through this snow. That is

why I was so out of breath, for I am a man who takes very little

exercise. I feel better now, and I will put the facts before you as

shortly and yet as clearly as I can.

“It is, of course, well known to you that in a successful banking

business as much depends upon our being able to find remunerative

investments for our funds as upon our increasing our connection and the

number of our depositors. One of our most lucrative means of laying out

money is in the shape of loans, where the security is unimpeachable. We

have done a good deal in this direction during the last few years, and

there are many noble families to whom we have advanced large sums upon

the security of their pictures, libraries, or plate.

“Yesterday morning I was seated in my office at the bank when a card

was brought in to me by one of the clerks. I started when I saw the

name, for it was that of none other than—well, perhaps even to you I

had better say no more than that it was a name which is a household

word all over the earth—one of the highest, noblest, most exalted names

in England. I was overwhelmed by the honour and attempted, when he

entered, to say so, but he plunged at once into business with the air

of a man who wishes to hurry quickly through a disagreeable task.

“‘Mr. Holder,’ said he, ‘I have been informed that you are in the habit

of advancing money.’

“‘The firm does so when the security is good.’ I answered.

“‘It is absolutely essential to me,’ said he, ‘that I should have £

50,000 at once. I could, of course, borrow so trifling a sum ten times

over from my friends, but I much prefer to make it a matter of business

and to carry out that business myself. In my position you can readily

understand that it is unwise to place one’s self under obligations.’

“‘For how long, may I ask, do you want this sum?’ I asked.

“‘Next Monday I have a large sum due to me, and I shall then most

certainly repay what you advance, with whatever interest you think it

right to charge. But it is very essential to me that the money should

be paid at once.’

“‘I should be happy to advance it without further parley from my own

private purse,’ said I, ‘were it not that the strain would be rather

more than it could bear. If, on the other hand, I am to do it in the

name of the firm, then in justice to my partner I must insist that,

even in your case, every businesslike precaution should be taken.’

“‘I should much prefer to have it so,’ said he, raising up a square,

black morocco case which he had laid beside his chair. ‘You have

doubtless heard of the Beryl Coronet?’

“‘One of the most precious public possessions of the empire,’ said I.

“‘Precisely.’ He opened the case, and there, imbedded in soft,

flesh-coloured velvet, lay the magnificent piece of jewellery which he

had named. ‘There are thirty-nine enormous beryls,’ said he, ‘and the

price of the gold chasing is incalculable. The lowest estimate would

put the worth of the coronet at double the sum which I have asked. I am

prepared to leave it with you as my security.’

“I took the precious case into my hands and looked in some perplexity

from it to my illustrious client.

“‘You doubt its value?’ he asked.

“‘Not at all. I only doubt—’

“‘The propriety of my leaving it. You may set your mind at rest about

that. I should not dream of doing so were it not absolutely certain

that I should be able in four days to reclaim it. It is a pure matter

of form. Is the security sufficient?’

“‘Ample.’

“‘You understand, Mr. Holder, that I am giving you a strong proof of

the confidence which I have in you, founded upon all that I have heard

of you. I rely upon you not only to be discreet and to refrain from all

gossip upon the matter but, above all, to preserve this coronet with

every possible precaution because I need not say that a great public

scandal would be caused if any harm were to befall it. Any injury to it

would be almost as serious as its complete loss, for there are no

beryls in the world to match these, and it would be impossible to

replace them. I leave it with you, however, with every confidence, and

I shall call for it in person on Monday morning.’

“Seeing that my client was anxious to leave, I said no more but,

calling for my cashier, I ordered him to pay over fifty £ 1000 notes.

When I was alone once more, however, with the precious case lying upon

the table in front of me, I could not but think with some misgivings of

the immense responsibility which it entailed upon me. There could be no

doubt that, as it was a national possession, a horrible scandal would

ensue if any misfortune should occur to it. I already regretted having

ever consented to take charge of it. However, it was too late to alter

the matter now, so I locked it up in my private safe and turned once

more to my work.

“When evening came I felt that it would be an imprudence to leave so

precious a thing in the office behind me. Bankers’ safes had been

forced before now, and why should not mine be? If so, how terrible

would be the position in which I should find myself! I determined,

therefore, that for the next few days I would always carry the case

backward and forward with me, so that it might never be really out of

my reach. With this intention, I called a cab and drove out to my house

at Streatham, carrying the jewel with me. I did not breathe freely

until I had taken it upstairs and locked it in the bureau of my

dressing-room.

“And now a word as to my household, Mr. Holmes, for I wish you to

thoroughly understand the situation. My groom and my page sleep out of

the house, and may be set aside altogether. I have three maid-servants

who have been with me a number of years and whose absolute reliability

is quite above suspicion. Another, Lucy Parr, the second waiting-maid,

has only been in my service a few months. She came with an excellent

character, however, and has always given me satisfaction. She is a very

pretty girl and has attracted admirers who have occasionally hung about

the place. That is the only drawback which we have found to her, but we

believe her to be a thoroughly good girl in every way.

“So much for the servants. My family itself is so small that it will

not take me long to describe it. I am a widower and have an only son,

Arthur. He has been a disappointment to me, Mr. Holmes—a grievous

disappointment. I have no doubt that I am myself to blame. People tell

me that I have spoiled him. Very likely I have. When my dear wife died

I felt that he was all I had to love. I could not bear to see the smile

fade even for a moment from his face. I have never denied him a wish.

Perhaps it would have been better for both of us had I been sterner,

but I meant it for the best.

“It was naturally my intention that he should succeed me in my

business, but he was not of a business turn. He was wild, wayward, and,

to speak the truth, I could not trust him in the handling of large sums

of money. When he was young he became a member of an aristocratic club,

and there, having charming manners, he was soon the intimate of a

number of men with long purses and expensive habits. He learned to play

heavily at cards and to squander money on the turf, until he had again

and again to come to me and implore me to give him an advance upon his

allowance, that he might settle his debts of honour. He tried more than

once to break away from the dangerous company which he was keeping, but

each time the influence of his friend, Sir George Burnwell, was enough

to draw him back again.

“And, indeed, I could not wonder that such a man as Sir George Burnwell

should gain an influence over him, for he has frequently brought him to

my house, and I have found myself that I could hardly resist the

fascination of his manner. He is older than Arthur, a man of the world

to his finger-tips, one who had been everywhere, seen everything, a

brilliant talker, and a man of great personal beauty. Yet when I think

of him in cold blood, far away from the glamour of his presence, I am

convinced from his cynical speech and the look which I have caught in

his eyes that he is one who should be deeply distrusted. So I think,

and so, too, thinks my little Mary, who has a woman’s quick insight

into character.

“And now there is only she to be described. She is my niece; but when

my brother died five years ago and left her alone in the world I

adopted her, and have looked upon her ever since as my daughter. She is

a sunbeam in my house—sweet, loving, beautiful, a wonderful manager and

housekeeper, yet as tender and quiet and gentle as a woman could be.

She is my right hand. I do not know what I could do without her. In

only one matter has she ever gone against my wishes. Twice my boy has

asked her to marry him, for he loves her devotedly, but each time she

has refused him. I think that if anyone could have drawn him into the

right path it would have been she, and that his marriage might have

changed his whole life; but now, alas! it is too late—forever too late!

“Now, Mr. Holmes, you know the people who live under my roof, and I

shall continue with my miserable story.

“When we were taking coffee in the drawing-room that night after

dinner, I told Arthur and Mary my experience, and of the precious

treasure which we had under our roof, suppressing only the name of my

client. Lucy Parr, who had brought in the coffee, had, I am sure, left

the room; but I cannot swear that the door was closed. Mary and Arthur

were much interested and wished to see the famous coronet, but I

thought it better not to disturb it.

“‘Where have you put it?’ asked Arthur.

“‘In my own bureau.’

“‘Well, I hope to goodness the house won’t be burgled during the

night.’ said he.

“‘It is locked up,’ I answered.

“‘Oh, any old key will fit that bureau. When I was a youngster I have

opened it myself with the key of the box-room cupboard.’

“He often had a wild way of talking, so that I thought little of what

he said. He followed me to my room, however, that night with a very

grave face.

“‘Look here, dad,’ said he with his eyes cast down, ‘can you let me

have £ 200?’

“‘No, I cannot!’ I answered sharply. ‘I have been far too generous with

you in money matters.’

“‘You have been very kind,’ said he, ‘but I must have this money, or

else I can never show my face inside the club again.’

“‘And a very good thing, too!’ I cried.

“‘Yes, but you would not have me leave it a dishonoured man,’ said he.

‘I could not bear the disgrace. I must raise the money in some way, and

if you will not let me have it, then I must try other means.’

“I was very angry, for this was the third demand during the month. ‘You

shall not have a farthing from me,’ I cried, on which he bowed and left

the room without another word.

“When he was gone I unlocked my bureau, made sure that my treasure was

safe, and locked it again. Then I started to go round the house to see

that all was secure—a duty which I usually leave to Mary but which I

thought it well to perform myself that night. As I came down the stairs

I saw Mary herself at the side window of the hall, which she closed and

fastened as I approached.

“‘Tell me, dad,’ said she, looking, I thought, a little disturbed, ‘did

you give Lucy, the maid, leave to go out to-night?’

“‘Certainly not.’

“‘She came in just now by the back door. I have no doubt that she has

only been to the side gate to see someone, but I think that it is

hardly safe and should be stopped.’

“‘You must speak to her in the morning, or I will if you prefer it. Are

you sure that everything is fastened?’

“‘Quite sure, dad.’

“‘Then, good-night.’ I kissed her and went up to my bedroom again,

where I was soon asleep.

“I am endeavouring to tell you everything, Mr. Holmes, which may have

any bearing upon the case, but I beg that you will question me upon any

point which I do not make clear.”

“On the contrary, your statement is singularly lucid.”

“I come to a part of my story now in which I should wish to be

particularly so. I am not a very heavy sleeper, and the anxiety in my

mind tended, no doubt, to make me even less so than usual. About two in

the morning, then, I was awakened by some sound in the house. It had

ceased ere I was wide awake, but it had left an impression behind it as

though a window had gently closed somewhere. I lay listening with all

my ears. Suddenly, to my horror, there was a distinct sound of

footsteps moving softly in the next room. I slipped out of bed, all', 3220)

door.

“‘Arthur!’ I screamed, ‘you villain! you thief! How dare you touch that

coronet?’

“The gas was half up, as I had left it, and my unhappy boy, dressed

only in his shirt and trousers, was standing beside the light, holding

the coronet in his hands. He appeared to be wrenching at it, or bending

it with all his strength. At my cry he dropped it from his grasp and

turned as pale as death. I snatched it up and examined it. One of the

gold corners, with three of the beryls in it, was missing.

“‘You blackguard!’ I shouted, beside myself with rage. ‘You have

destroyed it! You have dishonoured me forever! Where are the jewels

which you have stolen?’

“‘Stolen!’ he cried.

“‘Yes, thief!’ I roared, shaking him by the shoulder.

“‘There are none missing. There cannot be any missing,’ said he.

“‘There are three missing. And you know where they are. Must I call you

a liar as well as a thief? Did I not see you trying to tear off another

piece?’

“‘You have called me names enough,’ said he, ‘I will not stand it any

longer. I shall not say another word about this business, since you

have chosen to insult me. I will leave your house in the morning and

make my own way in the world.’

“‘You shall leave it in the hands of the police!’ I cried half-mad with

grief and rage. ‘I shall have this matter probed to the bottom.’

“‘You shall learn nothing from me,’ said he with a passion such as I

should not have thought was in his nature. ‘If you choose to call the

police, let the police find what they can.’

“By this time the whole house was astir, for I had raised my voice in

my anger. Mary was the first to rush into my room, and, at the sight of

the coronet and of Arthur’s face, she read the whole story and, with a

scream, fell down senseless on the ground. I sent the housemaid for the

police and put the investigation into their hands at once. When the

inspector and a constable entered the house, Arthur, who had stood

sullenly with his arms folded, asked me whether it was my intention to

charge him with theft. I answered that it had ceased to be a private

matter, but had become a public one, since the ruined coronet was

national property. I was determined that the law should have its way in

everything.

“‘At least,’ said he, ‘you will not have me arrested at once. It would

be to your advantage as well as mine if I might leave the house for

five minutes.’

“‘That you may get away, or perhaps that you may conceal what you have

stolen,’ said I. And then, realising the dreadful position in which I

was placed, I implored him to remember that not only my honour but that

of one who was far greater than I was at stake; and that he threatened

to raise a scandal which would convulse the nation. He might avert it

all if he would but tell me what he had done with the three missing

stones.

“‘You may as well face the matter,’ said I; ‘you have been caught in

the act, and no confession could make your guilt more heinous. If you

but make such reparation as is in your power, by telling us where the

beryls are, all shall be forgiven and forgotten.’

“‘Keep your forgiveness for those who ask for it,’ he answered, turning

away from me with a sneer. I saw that he was too hardened for any words

of mine to influence him. There was but one way for it. I called in the

inspector and gave him into custody. A search was made at once not only

of his person but of his room and of every portion of the house where

he could possibly have concealed the gems; but no trace of them could

be found, nor would the wretched boy open his mouth for all our

persuasions and our threats. This morning he was removed to a cell, and

I, after going through all the police formalities, have hurried round

to you to implore you to use your skill in unravelling the matter. The

police have openly confessed that they can at present make nothing of

it. You may go to any expense which you think necessary. I have already

offered a reward of £ 1000. My God, what shall I do! I have lost my

honour, my gems, and my son in one night. Oh, what shall I do!”

He put a hand on either side of his head and rocked himself to and fro,

droning to himself like a child whose grief has got beyond words.

Sherlock Holmes sat silent for some few minutes, with his brows knitted

and his eyes fixed upon the fire.

“Do you receive much company?” he asked.

“None save my partner with his family and an occasional friend of

Arthur’s. Sir George Burnwell has been several times lately. No one

else, I think.”

“Do you go out much in society?”

“Arthur does. Mary and I stay at home. We neither of us care for it.”

“That is unusual in a young girl.”

“She is of a quiet nature. Besides, she is not so very young. She is

four-and-twenty.”

“This matter, from what you say, seems to have been a shock to her

also.”

“Terrible! She is even more affected than I.”

“You have neither of you any doubt as to your son’s guilt?”

“How can we have when I saw him with my own eyes with the coronet in

his hands.”

“I hardly consider that a conclusive proof. Was the remainder of the

coronet at all injured?”

“Yes, it was twisted.”

“Do you not think, then, that he might have been trying to straighten

it?”

“God bless you! You are doing what you can for him and for me. But it

is too heavy a task. What was he doing there at all? If his purpose

were innocent, why did he not say so?”

“Precisely. And if it were guilty, why did he not invent a lie? His

silence appears to me to cut both ways. There are several singular

points about the case. What did the police think of the noise which

awoke you from your sleep?”

“They considered that it might be caused by Arthur’s closing his

bedroom door.”

“A likely story! As if a man bent on felony would slam his door so as

to wake a household. What did they say, then, of the disappearance of

these gems?”

“They are still sounding the planking and probing the furniture in the

hope of finding them.”

“Have they thought of looking outside the house?”

“Yes, they have shown extraordinary energy. The whole garden has

already been minutely examined.”

“Now, my dear sir,” said Holmes, “is it not obvious to you now that

this matter really strikes very much deeper than either you or the

police were at first inclined to think? It appeared to you to be a

simple case; to me it seems exceedingly complex. Consider what is

involved by your theory. You suppose that your son came down from his

bed, went, at great risk, to your dressing-room, opened your bureau,

took out your coronet, broke off by main force a small portion of it,

went off to some other place, concealed three gems out of the

thirty-nine, with such skill that nobody can find them, and then

returned with the other thirty-six into the room in which he exposed

himself to the greatest danger of being discovered. I ask you now, is

such a theory tenable?”

“But what other is there?” cried the banker with a gesture of despair.

“If his motives were innocent, why does he not explain them?”

“It is our task to find that out,” replied Holmes; “so now, if you

please, Mr. Holder, we will set off for Streatham together, and devote

an hour to glancing a little more closely into details.”

My friend insisted upon my accompanying them in their expedition, which

I was eager enough to do, for my curiosity and sympathy were deeply

stirred by the story to which we had listened. I confess that the guilt

of the banker’s son appeared to me to be as obvious as it did to his

unhappy father, but still I had such faith in Holmes’ judgment that I

felt that there must be some grounds for hope as long as he was

dissatisfied with the accepted explanation. He hardly spoke a word the

whole way out to the southern suburb, but sat with his chin upon his

breast and his hat drawn over his eyes, sunk in the deepest thought.

Our client appeared to have taken fresh heart at the little glimpse of

hope which had been presented to him, and he even broke into a

desultory chat with me over his business affairs. A short railway

journey and a shorter walk brought us to Fairbank, the modest residence

of the great financier.

Fairbank was a good-sized square house of white stone, standing back a

little from the road. A double carriage-sweep, with a snow-clad lawn,

stretched down in front to two large iron gates which closed the

entrance. On the right side was a small wooden thicket, which led into

a narrow path between two neat hedges stretching from the road to the

kitchen door, and forming the tradesmen’s entrance. On the left ran a

lane which led to the stables, and was not itself within the grounds at

all, being a public, though little used, thoroughfare. Holmes left us

standing at the door and walked slowly all round the house, across the

front, down the tradesmen’s path, and so round by the garden behind

into the stable lane. So long was he that Mr. Holder and I went into

the dining-room and waited by the fire until he should return. We were

sitting there in silence when the door opened and a young lady came in.

She was rather above the middle height, slim, with dark hair and eyes,

which seemed the darker against the absolute pallor of her skin. I do

not think that I have ever seen such deadly paleness in a woman’s face.

Her lips, too, were bloodless, but her eyes were flushed with crying.

As she swept silently into the room she impressed me with a greater

sense of grief than the banker had done in the morning, and it was the

more striking in her as she was evidently a woman of strong character,

with immense capacity for self-restraint. Disregarding my presence, she

went straight to her uncle and passed her hand over his head with a

sweet womanly caress.

“You have given orders that Arthur should be liberated, have you not,

dad?” she asked.

“No, no, my girl, the matter must be probed to the bottom.”

“But I am so sure that he is innocent. You know what woman’s instincts

are. I know that he has done no harm and that you will be sorry for

having acted so harshly.”

“Why is he silent, then, if he is innocent?”

“Who knows? Perhaps because he was so angry that you should suspect

him.”

“How could I help suspecting him, when I actually saw him with the

coronet in his hand?”

“Oh, but he had only picked it up to look at it. Oh, do, do take my

word for it that he is innocent. Let the matter drop and say no more.

It is so dreadful to think of our dear Arthur in prison!”

“I shall never let it drop until the gems are found—never, Mary! Your

affection for Arthur blinds you as to the awful consequences to me. Far

from hushing the thing up, I have brought a gentleman down from London

to inquire more deeply into it.”

“This gentleman?” she asked, facing round to me.

“No, his friend. He wished us to leave him alone. He is round in the

stable lane now.”

“The stable lane?” She raised her dark eyebrows. “What can he hope to

find there? Ah! this, I suppose, is he. I trust, sir, that you will

succeed in proving, what I feel sure is the truth, that my cousin

Arthur is innocent of this crime.”

“I fully share your opinion, and I trust, with you, that we may prove

it,” returned Holmes, going back to the mat to knock the snow from his

shoes. “I believe I have the honour of addressing Miss Mary Holder.

Might I ask you a question or two?”

“Pray do, sir, if it may help to clear this horrible affair up.”

“You heard nothing yourself last night?”

“Nothing, until my uncle here began to speak loudly. I heard that, and

I came down.”

“You shut up the windows and doors the night before. Did you fasten all

the windows?”

“Yes.”

“Were they all fastened this morning?”

“Yes.”

“You have a maid who has a sweetheart? I think that you remarked to

your uncle last night that she had been out to see him?”

“Yes, and she was the girl who waited in the drawing-room, and who may

have heard uncle’s remarks about the coronet.”

“I see. You infer that she may have gone out to tell her sweetheart,

and that the two may have planned the robbery.”

“But what is the good of all these vague theories,” cried the banker

impatiently, “when I have told you that I saw Arthur with the coronet

in his hands?”

“Wait a little, Mr. Holder. We must come back to that. About this girl,

Miss Holder. You saw her return by the kitchen door, I presume?”

“Yes; when I went to see if the door was fastened for the night I met

her slipping in. I saw the man, too, in the gloom.”

“Do you know him?”

“Oh, yes! he is the greengrocer who brings our vegetables round. His

name is Francis Prosper.”

“He stood,” said Holmes, “to the left of the door—that is to say,

farther up the path than is necessary to reach the door?”

“Yes, he did.”

“And he is a man with a wooden leg?”

Something like fear sprang up in the young lady’s expressive black

eyes. “Why, you are like a magician,” said she. “How do you know that?”

She smiled, but there was no answering smile in Holmes’ thin, eager

face.

“I should be very glad now to go upstairs,” said he. “I shall probably

wish to go over the outside of the house again. Perhaps I had better

take a look at the lower windows before I go up.”

He walked swiftly round from one to the other, pausing only at the

large one which looked from the hall onto the stable lane. This he

opened and made a very careful examination of the sill with his

powerful magnifying lens. “Now we shall go upstairs,” said he at last.

The banker’s dressing-room was a plainly furnished little chamber, with

a grey carpet, a large bureau, and a long mirror. Holmes went to the

bureau first and looked hard at the lock.

“Which key was used to open it?” he asked.

“That which my son himself indicated—that of the cupboard of the

lumber-room.”

“Have you it here?”

“That is it on the dressing-table.”

Sherlock Holmes took it up and opened the bureau.

“It is a noiseless lock,” said he. “It is no wonder that it did not

wake you. This case, I presume, contains the coronet. We must have a

look at it.” He opened the case, and taking out the diadem he laid it

upon the table. It was a magnificent specimen of the jeweller’s art,

and the thirty-six stones were the finest that I have ever seen. At one

side of the coronet was a cracked edge, where a corner holding three

gems had been torn away.

“Now, Mr. Holder,” said Holmes, “here is the corner which corresponds

to that which has been so unfortunately lost. Might I beg that you will

break it off.”

The banker recoiled in horror. “I should not dream of trying,” said he.

“Then I will.” Holmes suddenly bent his strength upon it, but without

result. “I feel it give a little,” said he; “but, though I am

exceptionally strong in the fingers, it would take me all my time to

break it. An ordinary man could not do it. Now, what do you think would

happen if I did break it, Mr. Holder? There would be a noise like a

pistol shot. Do you tell me that all this happened within a few yards

of your bed and that you heard nothing of it?”

“I do not know what to think. It is all dark to me.”

“But perhaps it may grow lighter as we go. What do you think, Miss

Holder?”

“I confess that I still share my uncle’s perplexity.”

“Your son had no shoes or slippers on when you saw him?”

“He had nothing on save only his trousers and shirt.”

“Thank you. We have certainly been favoured with extraordinary luck

during this inquiry, and it will be entirely our own fault if we do not

succeed in clearing the matter up. With your permission, Mr. Holder, I

shall now continue my investigations outside.”

He went alone, at his own request, for he explained that any

unnecessary footmarks might make his task more difficult. For an hour

or more he was at work, returning at last with his feet heavy with snow

and his features as inscrutable as ever.

“I think that I have seen now all that there is to see, Mr. Holder,”

said he; “I can serve you best by returning to my rooms.”

“But the gems, Mr. Holmes. Where are they?”

“I cannot tell.”

The banker wrung his hands. “I shall never see them again!” he cried.

“And my son? You give me hopes?”

“My opinion is in no way altered.”

“Then, for God’s sake, what was this dark business which was acted in

my house last night?”

“If you can call upon me at my Baker Street rooms to-morrow morning

between nine and ten I shall be happy to do what I can to make it

clearer. I understand that you give me _carte blanche_ to act for you,

provided only that I get back the gems, and that you place no limit on

the sum I may draw.”

“I would give my fortune to have them back.”

“Very good. I shall look into the matter between this and then.

Good-bye; it is just possible that I may have to come over here again

before evening.”

It was obvious to me that my companion’s mind was now made up about the

case, although what his conclusions were was more than I could even

dimly imagine. Several times during our homeward journey I endeavoured

to sound him upon the point, but he always glided away to some other

topic, until at last I gave it over in despair. It was not yet three

With his collar turned up, his shiny, seedy coat, his red cravat, and

his worn boots, he was a perfect sample of the class.

“I think that this should do,” said he, glancing into the glass above

the fireplace. “I only wish that you could come with me, Watson, but I

fear that it won’t do. I may be on the trail in this matter, or I may

be following a will-o’-the-wisp, but I shall soon know which it is. I

hope that I may be back in a few hours.” He cut a slice of beef from

the joint upon the sideboard, sandwiched it between two rounds of

bread, and thrusting this rude meal into his pocket he started off upon

his expedition.

I had just finished my tea when he returned, evidently in excellent

spirits, swinging an old elastic-sided boot in his hand. He chucked it

down into a corner and helped himself to a cup of tea.

“I only looked in as I passed,” said he. “I am going right on.”

“Where to?”

“Oh, to the other side of the West End. It may be some time before I

get back. Don’t wait up for me in case I should be late.”

“How are you getting on?”

“Oh, so so. Nothing to complain of. I have been out to Streatham since

I saw you last, but I did not call at the house. It is a very sweet

little problem, and I would not have missed it for a good deal.

However, I must not sit gossiping here, but must get these disreputable

clothes off and return to my highly respectable self.”

I could see by his manner that he had stronger reasons for satisfaction

than his words alone would imply. His eyes twinkled, and there was even

a touch of colour upon his sallow cheeks. He hastened upstairs, and a

few minutes later I heard the slam of the hall door, which told me that

he was off once more upon his congenial hunt.

I waited until midnight, but there was no sign of his return, so I

retired to my room. It was no uncommon thing for him to be away for

days and nights on end when he was hot upon a scent, so that his

lateness caused me no surprise. I do not know at what hour he came in,

but when I came down to breakfast in the morning there he was with a

cup of coffee in one hand and the paper in the other, as fresh and trim

as possible.

“You will excuse my beginning without you, Watson,” said he, “but you

remember that our client has rather an early appointment this morning.”

“Why, it is after nine now,” I answered. “I should not be surprised if

that were he. I thought I heard a ring.”

It was, indeed, our friend the financier. I was shocked by the change

which had come over him, for his face which was naturally of a broad

and massive mould, was now pinched and fallen in, while his hair seemed

to me at least a shade whiter. He entered with a weariness and lethargy

which was even more painful than his violence of the morning before,

and he dropped heavily into the armchair which I pushed forward for

him.

“I do not know what I have done to be so severely tried,” said he.

“Only two days ago I was a happy and prosperous man, without a care in

the world. Now I am left to a lonely and dishonoured age. One sorrow

comes close upon the heels of another. My niece, Mary, has deserted

me.”

“Deserted you?”

“Yes. Her bed this morning had not been slept in, her room was empty,

and a note for me lay upon the hall table. I had said to her last

night, in sorrow and not in anger, that if she had married my boy all

might have been well with him. Perhaps it was thoughtless of me to say

so. It is to that remark that she refers in this note:

    “‘MY DEAREST UNCLE,—I feel that I have brought trouble upon you,

    and that if I had acted differently this terrible misfortune might

    never have occurred. I cannot, with this thought in my mind, ever

    again be happy under your roof, and I feel that I must leave you

    forever. Do not worry about my future, for that is provided for;

    and, above all, do not search for me, for it will be fruitless

    labour and an ill-service to me. In life or in death, I am ever

    your loving,

    “‘MARY.’

“What could she mean by that note, Mr. Holmes? Do you think it points

to suicide?”

“No, no, nothing of the kind. It is perhaps the best possible solution.

I trust, Mr. Holder, that you are nearing the end of your troubles.”

“Ha! You say so! You have heard something, Mr. Holmes; you have learned

something! Where are the gems?”

“You would not think £ 1000 apiece an excessive sum for them?”

“I would pay ten.”

“That would be unnecessary. Three thousand will cover the matter. And

there is a little reward, I fancy. Have you your cheque-book? Here is a

pen. Better make it out for £ 4000.”

With a dazed face the banker made out the required check. Holmes walked

over to his desk, took out a little triangular piece of gold with three

gems in it, and threw it down upon the table.

With a shriek of joy our client clutched it up.

“You have it!” he gasped. “I am saved! I am saved!”

The reaction of joy was as passionate as his grief had been, and he

hugged his recovered gems to his bosom.

“There is one other thing you owe, Mr. Holder,” said Sherlock Holmes

rather sternly.

“Owe!” He caught up a pen. “Name the sum, and I will pay it.”

“No, the debt is not to me. You owe a very humble apology to that noble

lad, your son, who has carried himself in this matter as I should be

proud to see my own son do, should I ever chance to have one.”

“Then it was not Arthur who took them?”

“I told you yesterday, and I repeat to-day, that it was not.”

“You are sure of it! Then let us hurry to him at once to let him know

that the truth is known.”

“He knows it already. When I had cleared it all up I had an interview

with him, and finding that he would not tell me the story, I told it to

him, on which he had to confess that I was right and to add the very

few details which were not yet quite clear to me. Your news of this

morning, however, may open his lips.”

“For Heaven’s sake, tell me, then, what is this extraordinary mystery!”

“I will do so, and I will show you the steps by which I reached it. And

let me say to you, first, that which it is hardest for me to say and

for you to hear: there has been an understanding between Sir George

Burnwell and your niece Mary. They have now fled together.”

“My Mary? Impossible!”

“It is unfortunately more than possible; it is certain. Neither you nor

your son knew the true character of this man when you admitted him into

your family circle. He is one of the most dangerous men in England—a

ruined gambler, an absolutely desperate villain, a man without heart or

conscience. Your niece knew nothing of such men. When he breathed his

vows to her, as he had done to a hundred before her, she flattered

herself that she alone had touched his heart. The devil knows best what

he said, but at least she became his tool and was in the habit of

seeing him nearly every evening.”

“I cannot, and I will not, believe it!” cried the banker with an ashen

face.

“I will tell you, then, what occurred in your house last night. Your

niece, when you had, as she thought, gone to your room, slipped down

and talked to her lover through the window which leads into the stable

lane. His footmarks had pressed right through the snow, so long had he

stood there. She told him of the coronet. His wicked lust for gold

kindled at the news, and he bent her to his will. I have no doubt that

she loved you, but there are women in whom the love of a lover

extinguishes all other loves, and I think that she must have been one.

She had hardly listened to his instructions when she saw you coming

downstairs, on which she closed the window rapidly and told you about

one of the servants’ escapade with her wooden-legged lover, which was

all perfectly true.

“Your boy, Arthur, went to bed after his interview with you but he

slept badly on account of his uneasiness about his club debts. In the

middle of the night he heard a soft tread pass his door, so he rose

and, looking out, was surprised to see his cousin walking very

stealthily along the passage until she disappeared into your

dressing-room. Petrified with astonishment, the lad slipped on some

clothes and waited there in the dark to see what would come of this

strange affair. Presently she emerged from the room again, and in the

light of the passage-lamp your son saw that she carried the precious

coronet in her hands. She passed down the stairs, and he, thrilling

with horror, ran along and slipped behind the curtain near your door,

whence he could see what passed in the hall beneath. He saw her

stealthily open the window, hand out the coronet to someone in the

gloom, and then closing it once more hurry back to her room, passing

quite close to where he stood hid behind the curtain.

“As long as she was on the scene he could not take any action without a

horrible exposure of the woman whom he loved. But the instant that she

was gone he realised how crushing a misfortune this would be for you,

and how all-important it was to set it right. He rushed down, just as

he was, in his bare feet, opened the window, sprang out into the snow,

and ran down the lane, where he could see a dark figure in the

moonlight. Sir George Burnwell tried to get away, but Arthur caught

him, and there was a struggle between them, your lad tugging at one

side of the coronet, and his opponent at the other. In the scuffle,

your son struck Sir George and cut him over the eye. Then something

suddenly snapped, and your son, finding that he had the coronet in his

hands, rushed back, closed the window, ascended to your room, and had

just observed that the coronet had been twisted in the struggle and was

endeavouring to straighten it when you appeared upon the scene.”

“Is it possible?” gasped the banker.

“You then roused his anger by calling him names at a moment when he

felt that he had deserved your warmest thanks. He could not explain the

true state of affairs without betraying one who certainly deserved

little enough consideration at his hands. He took the more chivalrous

view, however, and preserved her secret.”

“And that was why she shrieked and fainted when she saw the coronet,”

cried Mr. Holder. “Oh, my God! what a blind fool I have been! And his

asking to be allowed to go out for five minutes! The dear fellow wanted

to see if the missing piece were at the scene of the struggle. How

cruelly I have misjudged him!”

“When I arrived at the house,” continued Holmes, “I at once went very

carefully round it to observe if there were any traces in the snow

which might help me. I knew that none had fallen since the evening

before, and also that there had been a strong frost to preserve

impressions. I passed along the tradesmen’s path, but found it all

trampled down and indistinguishable. Just beyond it, however, at the

far side of the kitchen door, a woman had stood and talked with a man,

whose round impressions on one side showed that he had a wooden leg. I

could even tell that they had been disturbed, for the woman had run

back swiftly to the door, as was shown by the deep toe and light heel

marks, while Wooden-leg had waited a little, and then had gone away. I

thought at the time that this might be the maid and her sweetheart, of

whom you had already spoken to me, and inquiry showed it was so. I

passed round the garden without seeing anything more than random

tracks, which I took to be the police; but when I got into the stable

lane a very long and complex story was written in the snow in front of

me.

“There was a double line of tracks of a booted man, and a second double

line which I saw with delight belonged to a man with naked feet. I was

at once convinced from what you had told me that the latter was your

son. The first had walked both ways, but the other had run swiftly, and

as his tread was marked in places over the depression of the boot, it

was obvious that he had passed after the other. I followed them up and

found they led to the hall window, where Boots had worn all the snow

away while waiting. Then I walked to the other end, which was a hundred

yards or more down the lane. I saw where Boots had faced round, where

the snow was cut up as though there had been a struggle, and, finally,

where a few drops of blood had fallen, to show me that I was not

mistaken. Boots had then run down the lane, and another little smudge

of blood showed that it was he who had been hurt. When he came to the

high road at the other end, I found that the pavement had been cleared,

so there was an end to that clue.

“On entering the house, however, I examined, as you remember, the sill

and framework of the hall window with my lens, and I could at once see

that someone had passed out. I could distinguish the outline of an

instep where the wet foot had been placed in coming in. I was then

beginning to be able to form an opinion as to what had occurred. A man

had waited outside the window; someone had brought the gems; the deed

had been overseen by your son; he had pursued the thief; had struggled

with him; they had each tugged at the coronet, their united strength

causing injuries which neither alone could have effected. He had

returned with the prize, but had left a fragment in the grasp of his

opponent. So far I was clear. The question now was, who was the man, and

who was it brought him the coronet?

“It is an old maxim of mine that when you have excluded the impossible,

whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth. Now, I knew

that it was not you who had brought it down, so there only remained

your niece and the maids. But if it were the maids, why should your son

allow himself to be accused in their place? There could be no possible

reason. As he loved his cousin, however, there was an excellent

explanation why he should retain her secret—the more so as the secret

was a disgraceful one. When I remembered that you had seen her at that

window, and how she had fainted on seeing the coronet again, my

conjecture became a certainty.

“And who could it be who was her confederate? A lover evidently, for

who else could outweigh the love and gratitude which she must feel to

you? I knew that you went out little, and that your circle of friends

was a very limited one. But among them was Sir George Burnwell. I had

heard of him before as being a man of evil reputation among women. It

must have been he who wore those boots and retained the missing gems.

Even though he knew that Arthur had discovered him, he might still

flatter himself that he was safe, for the lad could not say a word

without compromising his own family.

“Well, your own good sense will suggest what measures I took next. I

went in the shape of a loafer to Sir George’s house, managed to pick up

an acquaintance with his valet, learned that his master had cut his

head the night before, and, finally, at the expense of six shillings,

made all sure by buying a pair of his cast-off shoes. With these I

journeyed down to Streatham and saw that they exactly fitted the

tracks.”

“I saw an ill-dressed vagabond in the lane yesterday evening,” said Mr.

Holder.

“Precisely. It was I. I found that I had my man, so I came home and

changed my clothes. It was a delicate part which I had to play then,

for I saw that a prosecution must be avoided to avert scandal, and I

knew that so astute a villain would see that our hands were tied in the

matter. I went and saw him. At first, of course, he denied everything.

But when I gave him every particular that had occurred, he tried to

bluster and took down a life-preserver from the wall. I knew my man,

however, and I clapped a pistol to his head before he could strike.

Then he became a little more reasonable. I told him that we would give

him a price for the stones he held—£ 1000 apiece. That brought out the

first signs of grief that he had shown. ‘Why, dash it all!’ said he,

‘I’ve let them go at six hundred for the three!’ I soon managed to get

the address of the receiver who had them, on promising him that there

would be no prosecution. Off I set to him, and after much chaffering I

got our stones at £ 1000 apiece. Then I looked in upon your son, told

him that all was right, and eventually got to my bed about two o’clock,

after what I may call a really hard day’s work.”

“A day which has saved England from a great public scandal,” said the

banker, rising. “Sir, I cannot find words to thank you, but you shall

not find me ungrateful for what you have done. Your skill has indeed

exceeded all that I have heard of it. And now I must fly to my dear boy

to apologise to him for the wrong which I have done him. As to what you

tell me of poor Mary, it goes to my very heart. Not even your skill can

inform me where she is now.”

“I think that we may safely say,” returned Holmes, “that she is

wherever Sir George Burnwell is. It is equally certain, too, that

whatever her sins are, they will soon receive a more than sufficient

punishment.”', 3236)
